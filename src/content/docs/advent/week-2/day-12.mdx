<h2>The Constellation Archives</h2>

On this twelfth day, the _Keeper_ leads you to the _Constellation Archives_, a celestial observatory where the milestones of countless creations are immortalized as shimmering stars in the vast tapestry of the cosmos. Overseeing this sacred domain is the _Chronicler of Continuity_, a diligent caretaker who ensures that each star shines with purpose, forming a map that others can follow.

The _Chronicler_ speaks of the _Chaos of Inconsistency_, a force that disrupts and obscures the brilliance of these celestial markers, turning them into faint, fractured lights. To guard against this, the stars must be crafted with care, their stories clear and enduring, so they may guide those who look to the heavens for direction.

**Releasing a first version** is a crucial milestone in the lifecycle of any Open Source project. It signals that your project is ready to be used, evaluated, or contributed to by the community. A properly managed release process brings clarity to your project's development progress, provides users with a snapshot of its current state, and establishes a clear foundation for future updates. Whether you're building a tool, library, or platform, crafting a release helps others engage with your work confidently.

**Today's challenge focuses on guiding you through the steps of creating your first release.** You'll learn how to properly version your project, communicate changes with a changelog, and share your work with the world. Completing this challenge will not only boost the visibility of your project but also lay the groundwork for future enhancements and contributions.

<Steps>

1. **Understand semantic versioning.**

    **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**  is a widely adopted standard for versioning software that makes it easier to understand the scope of changes between releases. Visit the [Semantic Versioning website](https://semver.org/) for detailed information.

    In short:
    - **MAJOR**: Increment this number for incompatible, breaking changes.
    - **MINOR**: Increment this number for backward-compatible feature additions.
    - **PATCH**: Increment this number for backward-compatible bug fixes.

    **For your first release, start with version `v0.1.0`.** This indicates that your project is still under development and may evolve significantly in the future.

1. **Set up the version.**

    Update or create the version information in your project files. For example:

    - In an npm project, edit the `package.json` file:

        ```json
        {
          "name": "my-project",
          "version": "0.1.0",
          "description": "My awesome project",
          ...
        }
        ```

    - For other ecosystems, check your package manager's documentation (e.g., Python's `setup.py`, Ruby's `gemspec`, etc.).
    - For applications, you can include the version in the footer or about page.

    Ensure this version is reflected wherever your project specifies its versioning information.

1. **Create a changelog.**

    A **changelog** helps users understand what's the differences between versions. Create a `CHANGELOG.md` file in your repository.
    
    Here's an example for your first release:

    ```md title="CHANGELOG.md"
    # Changelog

    ## v0.1.0

    This is the first release of the project.

    {/* insert your project's description here> */}

    ### Features

    - {/* insert your first feature here */}

    ### Docs
    - Added README file with basic project information

    ### Chore

    - Set up CI workflow
      - Spell check
      - Linting
      - Basic tests
    ```

    Commit and push this file to your repository.

    <Aside type="tip" title="Tip of the iceberg">
    Check out [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) for a detailed guide on writing changelogs.
    </Aside>

1. **Tag the release.**

    Tags mark specific points in your project's history. Use Git to tag your release:

    ```sh
    git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "chore(release): v0.1.0"
    git push origin v0.1.0
    ```

    This creates and pushes a tag named `v0.1.0` to your remote repository. Tags are displayed in the "Releases" section of your project on GitHub.

    <ContentImage src={day12Snowflake01} alt="" />

1. **Create the release on GitHub.**

    Release notes are a way to communicate what's new in your release. They help users understand what has changed and what they need to do to upgrade.
    
    You can write release notes in a Markdown file or directly in the GitHub release interface.

    Use the GitHub interface to create your release.

    <Steps>

    1. Navigate to the "Releases" section of your repository and click on the _Create a new release_ button.

        <ContentImage src={day12Snowflake02} alt="" />

    1. Click on _Choose a tag_, and select the tag you've just created (e.g., `v0.1.0`).

    1. Let the previous tag as `auto`.

    1. Enter a title for your release (e.g., "v0.1.0").

        <Aside type="tip" title="Generate release notes">
        There's a `Generate release notes` button that can help you create a draft of your release notes based on your commit messages. It will automatically fill in the release notes with the commit messages since the last release.

        However, it won't be useful in our case since it's based on the pull requests created between the last release and the current one. Since we don't have any pull requests yet, it won't generate anything automatically.
        </Aside>

    1. Add a description of your release.

        Copy the relevant section from your changelog to communicate changes effectively., or adapt it to make it more user-friendly.

    1. Click on the _Publish release_ button.

        <ContentImage src={day12Snowflake03} alt="" />

    1. Go back to your repository main page, and you'll see the release you've just created.

        <ContentImage src={day12Snowflake04} alt="" />

    </Steps>

1. **(Optional) Publish your project.**

    If your project is a library or tool that others will install, you can publish it to a package manager, you can publish it now.
    
    For npm, run:

    ```sh
    npm pack
    npm publish
    ```

    This command will make your package available on the npm registry for others to install. For other ecosystems, refer to the relevant publishing instructions (e.g., PyPI for Python).

</Steps>

**Congratulations on completing your first release!** This milestone not only formalizes your project's progress but also makes it easier for others to explore, use, and contribute to your work. By adopting Semantic Versioning, creating a clear changelog, and leveraging GitHub's release tools, you've set a solid foundation for future growth.

Take a moment to celebrate your achievement, and don't forget: regular releases and clear communication will make your project even more valuable to the community. Well done!

**Managing releases manually can become a tedious and error-prone process**, especially as your project grows and gains contributors. Automating release management allows you to streamline versioning, changelog generation, and deployment, ensuring that each release is consistent, traceable, and transparent. This saves time, minimizes mistakes, and boosts collaboration, enabling contributors to focus on development rather than administrative tasks.

**Today's challenge focuses on automating your release management process** by implementing automated versioning, generating changelogs, and deploying releases to production with a CI/CD pipeline. You will implement a system that handles versioning, creates changelogs automatically, and deploys new versions effortlessly, providing a more professional and scalable release process for your Open Source project.

<Steps>

1. **Implement semantic versioning.**

    This is probably already done but if not, ensure your project follows [Semantic Versioning (SemVer) guidelines](https://semver.org/) as it is the most widely adopted standard for versioning software.
    
    Increment the version number based on the type of changes made in each release:

    - **MAJOR**: Increment this number for incompatible, breaking changes.
    - **MINOR**: Increment this number for backward-compatible feature additions.
    - **PATCH**: Increment this number for backward-compatible bug fixes.

    Using semantic versioning allows contributors to understand the scope of changes just by looking at the version number. By automating the versioning process, you can avoid human error and ensure consistency.

1. **Configure automated versioning.**

    Consider using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) for your commit messages, and tools like [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) or [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to automatically manage versioning. Both tools allow you to automatically manage versioning. Both tools allow you to automatically update version numbers based on the type of changes made in your project.

    - **semantic-release** analyzes the commit history and commit messages using Conventional Commits specification to determine the appropriate version bump (major, minor, patch).
    - **Changesets** is another powerful tool for managing versions, especially in monorepos or multi-package projects. It works by creating "changeset" files that describe the changes between releases, and then it automates version bumping and changelog generation.

    Choose the tool that best fits your project's needs and set it up to automate versioning.

1. **Automate changelog generation.**

    Automatic changelog generation is a vital part of the release process. With tools like Changesets, [Standard version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version), [conventional-changelog-cli](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-cli), or built-in features from semantic-release, you can automatically generate a changelog that lists all changes made in each release, ensuring transparency and reducing manual effort.

    By using these tools, you can eliminate the need for manual changelog updates and ensure that your changelog is always in sync with your releases.

1. **Create release workflow in CI/CD pipeline.**

    To complete the automation process, set up a CI/CD pipeline to deploy your releases to the production environment. This ensures that every new version is automatically deployed, reducing manual intervention and providing a smooth release process.

    <Steps>

    1. Use CI/CD tools like [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), or [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) to create workflows that automatically trigger after a version update.
    
    1. Set up a release workflow that:
        - Runs tests to verify the release is stable.
        - Deploys the release to a staging or production environment.
        - Tags the release and pushes the changelog.
        - If applicable, publishes the release to a package manager, and to the GitHub release page by creating a new release.

    </Steps>

    This automated process will give your project a professional edge, as every release is tested and deployed automatically without manual intervention.

1. **Document your versioning policy.**

    It's essential to communicate our versioning policy clearly to contributors and users. Document your versioning strategy, including how version numbers are incremented, the rules for commit messages, and how changelogs are generated into your contributing guidelines. This will help maintain consistency as your project grows and more contributors get involved.

</Steps>

Automating release management not only saves time and reduces human error but also enhances the professionalism and reliability of your project. By implementing automated versioning, changelog generation, and CI/CD pipelines, you're making your project easier to maintain and scale. This process ensures that every release is consistent, transparent, and easy to track, helping you and your contributors focus on what really matters—building great features and improving the project.

**Congratulations on completing this challenge!** By automating your release management, you're streamlining your development process and setting your project up for success.

<hr />

As your Open Source efforts expand, managing and releasing multiple repositories efficiently becomes critical. This is particularly true for projects that involve monorepos or interconnected repositories that need to work together. Streamlining your workflows to handle simultaneous releases, synchronized dependencies, and consistent communication can save time, reduce errors, and improve the contributor experience.

**Today's challenge focuses on refining your release workflows for multiple repositories.** You will start by enabling simultaneous releases for monorepos or related repositories, then automate dependency updates, generate cross-repository release summaries, and maintain a central changelog. These steps will help you scale your project management while maintaining high-quality standards.

<Steps>

1. **Enable simultaneous releases.**

    Coordinating releases across interconnected repositories or packages can be challenging. By adopting tools and workflows designed for simultaneous releases, you can ensure all related repositories are updated in sync, reducing the risk of incompatibility or confusion.

    <Steps>

    1. **Monorepo scenario.**

        - Use a tool like [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) or [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage and release multiple packages within a monorepo.

        - Configure versioning and publishing workflows:

            - Use Lerna to manage versioning and publishing for each package.
            - Use Changesets to manage versioning and changelogs for each package.

        - These tools automate version updates, changelog generation, and publishing to package registries like npm. 

    1. **Multi-repository scenario.**

        Use CI/CD pipelines to trigger releases across repositories:
        
        - For example, create a "meta repository" with a workflow that triggers coordinated releases in sibling repositories using GitHub Actions or similar tools.
        - Use scripts and tools like [nx](https://nx.dev/) or custom orchestration scripts to ensure smooth cross-repository coordination.

    1. **Document the workflow.**

        As usual in the challenges of this level, documentation is key. Clearly define and document the release process to ensure all the core team follows the same standards.

    </Steps>

1. **Automate dependency updates between repositories.**

    Once simultaneous releases are in place, it's essential to ensure that dependencies between repositories are updated automatically. This avoids manual synchronization efforts and ensures compatibility across repositories.

    <Steps>

    1. **Configure dependency management.**

        You already have in place tools like Dependabot or Renovate to monitor and update dependencies at a dedicated time each week for external dependencies.
        
        Ensure these tools are also triggered by the release of a new version of a dependency in a related repository.

    1. **Centralize dependency policies.**

        If not already in place, create shared policies or configuration files to define update frequencies, testing strategies, and version ranges.

        The description must take into account the external dependencies and the internal dependencies between the repositories.

    1. **Test updates automatically.**

        Use CI pipelines to validate dependency updates before merging.

    </Steps>

1. **Generate cross-repository release summaries.**

    Informing contributors and users about changes across repositories can improve collaboration and transparency. Automating cross-repository release summaries ensures everyone stays updated.

    They need to know what dependencies have been updated, which ones depend on them, and what changes have been made in each repository so they can adapt their code accordingly.

    <Steps>

    1. **Set up release summary workflows.**

        Use GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools to aggregate release notes across repositories. Tools like [Release Drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) or custom scripts can pull changelog data and generate a summary.

    1. **Custom aggregation scripts.**

        Use GitHub's API via tools like [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit/rest.js/) to pull release notes or commit messages and combine them into a central summary.

    </Steps>

1. **Maintain a central changelog.**

    One possibility could be to have a central changelog that provides an overarching view of changes across all repositories. This can be especially useful for users and contributors who need to keep track of updates without navigating individual repositories.

    1. **Create a central changelog repository.**

        Use a dedicated repository for documentation, including a `CHANGELOG.md` summarizing updates from all related repositories.

    1. **Automate changelog updates.**

        Extend your workflows to automatically append changes from individual repositories to the central changelog. Tools like Changesets or custom scripts can assist here.

    1. **Organize for clarity.**

        Use structured headings and include links to the detailed release notes of individual repositories.

        ```md title="CHANGELOG.md"
        ## Multi-Repository Project - Release Summary (v2.3.0)  

        ### Repository A  
        - Added feature X ([#456](https://github.com/org/repo-a/pull/456))  
        - Fixed bug Y ([#457](https://github.com/org/repo-a/pull/457))  

        ### Repository B  
        - Updated dependency Z to v3.0.0  
        - Improved CI workflows  
        ```

</Steps>

Streamlining multi-repository release workflows not only improves efficiency but also reduces errors and enhances collaboration across repositories. By enabling simultaneous releases, synchronizing dependencies, generating cross-repository summaries, and maintaining a central changelog, you've taken an important step toward professionalizing your project management.

**Congratulations on completing this challenge!** Your project is now easier to maintain, more transparent, and better equipped to scale. Keep iterating as your repositories and contributors grow.

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>

- ✓ Simultaneous release processes are established for all relevant repositories or packages.
- ✓ Dependency updates are automated between repositories.
- ✓ Cross-repository release summaries are generated and shared.
- ✓ (Optional) A central changelog is maintained and updated automatically with changes from all repositories.
- ✓ Documentation for all workflows is provided to ensure long-term consistency.
