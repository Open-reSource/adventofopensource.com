<h2>The Resonance of Unity</h2>

The _Keeper of the Repos_ leads you into a radiant courtyard filled with intertwining melodies. Each sound rises and falls in perfect harmony, creating a living symphony that seems to resonate in your very core. This is the _Harmonic Courtyard_, a place where voices converge, each one contributing to a greater whole.

At the center of the courtyard stands the _Maestro of Synergy_, a poised figure whose every gesture guides the ebb and flow of collaboration. With each movement of their baton, the melodies align, their combined strength forming a powerful chorus.

> Every harmony relies on balance,

the _Maestro_ says, their voice calm but firm.

> Yet discord lurks in the absence of structure. Without clear direction, even the strongest voices can falter, and the symphony risks collapse.

You watch as a shadow, faint but persistent, edges along the courtyard—the _Discord of Miscommunication_. Its presence seems to dampen the melodies, threatening to unravel the balance.

The _Maestro_ looks to you, their eyes reflecting both hope and resolve.

> To preserve harmony, you must bring clarity and order to the symphony. Only then will the voices rise as one, uniting in a melody that echoes across the ages.

**Yesterday, you hit a major milestone by releasing the alpha version of your project.** This marks the point where your work is no longer just a solo effort; it becomes something you can share with others, inviting them to participate, test, and provide feedback. With community engagement comes an opportunity to refine and improve your project collaboratively.

Today's challenge focuses on setting up an essential part of any Open Source project: **issue templates**. Issues are a critical tool for tracking bugs, discussing features, and organizing contributions. By providing contributors with clear and structured guidance, you can ensure better communication and faster resolution of problems. Let's dive into how to create a simple bug report template to help your contributors help you!

<Steps>

1. **What are issues?**

    Issues are a built-in feature of repositories, designed to track tasks, bugs, feature requests, or ideas. They serve as the central communication hub between maintainers and contributors, enabling collaboration around a shared backlog.

    They are a way to communicate with the maintainers of a project and other contributors. Issues can be opened by anyone with a GitHub account, and they can be assigned to people, labeled, and closed when the task is completed.

    Each issue consists of several key fields:
    - **Title**: A short summary of the issue
    - **Description**: A detailed explanation, often written in Markdown
    - **Labels**: Tags that categorize issues.
      - Default labels in a GitHub repository are <Badge text="bug" />, <Badge text="documentation" />, <Badge text="duplicate" />, <Badge text="enhancement" />, <Badge text="good first issue" />, <Badge text="help wanted" />, <Badge text="invalid" />, <Badge text="question" />, <Badge text="wontfix" />
    - **Assignees**: People responsible for addressing the issue
    - **Projects** and **Milestones**: Optional tools for organizing issues into larger plans.

    For someone creating an issue, they can only fill out the title and description fields. But you can guide them further by providing a template with specific fields to fill out.

    <ContentImage src={day13Snowflake01} alt="" />

    Today, your objective is to create a basic Markdown issue template for bug reports, guiding contributors to provide essential information to address the issue effectively.

    The community can do that by default in GitHub by clicking on the `Issues` tab in your repository and then clicking on the `New issue` button.

1. **Create a bug report template.**

    Providing an issue template improves the clarity and completeness of bug reports. A well-defined bug report saves time, minimizes confusion, and helps maintainers address problems faster. Follow the steps below to create a Markdown-based template for bug reports.

    <Steps>

    1. In your repository, create a new file named `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`. This file will contain the template for bug reports.

        You can use the GitHub web interface for this or create the file locally and push it to your repository.

        By using GitHub interface, you'll see some information and guidance appear automatically to help you create a template. But let's not use that for now, as it's related to form-style templates. We'll create a simple Markdown template.

        <ContentImage src={day13Snowflake02} alt="" />

        <Aside>
        The `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory is a special location where GitHub looks for issue templates. By placing your templates here, you can organize them into different categories.
        </Aside>

    1. **Define the template content.**

        Copy the example below into your `bug_report.md` file, and customize it as needed. This template includes key fields that help contributors provide a detailed bug report:

        ```md title=".github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md"
        ---
        name: Bug Report
        about: Create a report to help us improve Avalanche
        title: "[BUG] "
        labels: bug
        assignees: ""
        ---

        **Describe the bug**

        A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

        **To Reproduce**

        Steps to reproduce the behavior:

        1. Go to '...'
        2. Click on '...'
        3. Scroll down to '...'
        4. See error

        **Expected behavior**

        A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

        **Screenshots**

        If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

        **Environment:**

        - OS: [e.g. iOS]
        - Browser [e.g. chrome, safari]
        - Version [e.g. 22]

        **Additional context**

        Add any other context about the problem here.
        ```

    1. **Commit and push the template.**

        Commit your changes with the `chore: create bug report template` message, then push them to your repository.

    1. **Test your template.**

        Go to the "Issues" tab in your repository and click on the _New issue_ button. You should see a difference in the interface: you now have a choice between creating a blank issue or using the template you just created.

        <ContentImage src={day13Snowflake03} alt="" />

        Let's see how it looks like... click on _Bug Report_ and you'll see a pre-filled issue form with the template you created.

        <ContentImage src={day13Snowflake04} alt="" />

    1. **Update the README.**

        To guide contributors on how to report bugs, update your `README.md` with a link to create new issues using your template:

        ```diff title="README.md"
        Please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating in the community.
        +
        +## Bugs and Feature Requests

        ## License
        ```

        <Aside type="tip" title="Tip of the iceberg">
        Use the `/new/choose` URL to give contributors the option to select from multiple templates (if you add more in the future).
        </Aside>

    </Steps>

</Steps>

**By completing this challenge, you've set the foundation for effective collaboration with your contributors.** Issue templates ensure that bug reports are clear, complete, and actionable, saving time for both you and your community.

Congratulations! This is a small yet impactful step in professionalizing your project and fostering a productive Open Source environment. **Keep going—you're building something great!**

**You can create additional templates** for different types of issues, such as feature requests, documentation improvements, security issues, and performance issues. That's up to you!

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>

- ✓ A `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` file exists in your repository.
- ✓ The new issue template appears in the "Issues" tab when creating a new issue.

<hr />

**As your Open Source project grows, so does the variety of issues raised by contributors and users.** Bug reports, feature requests, and documentation updates all require different information to be actionable, yet a lack of structure can lead to incomplete or unclear submissions. Providing tailored issue templates ensures contributors know exactly what details are needed, saving time for both them and the maintainers. It also enhances the quality of communication, making your project easier to manage and more accessible for newcomers.

**Today's challenge focuses on creating issue templates for different types of contributions**—such as bug reports, feature requests, and documentation updates. You'll also configure a central configuration file to manage how these templates are displayed and add helpful links for contributors. By the end of this challenge, your project will have a professional, structured workflow for handling issues efficiently.

This challenge describes the process for GitHub repositories, but similar features are available in other platforms like GitLab and Bitbucket. Please follow the documentation for your chosen platform to implement issue templates.

<Steps>

1. **Create a directory for issue templates.**

    Before creating the templates, check that your repository has a `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory. If it doesn't exist, create it.

    This directory will contain all your issue templates, organized by type.

1. **Write templates for specific issue types.**

    Each template should focus on a specific issue type, such as bug reports, feature requests, or documentation improvements.

    **Create a bug report template.**

    <Steps>

    1. Inside the `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory, create a new file named `bug_report.md`.

    1. Include fields for the following details:

        - A clear description of the bug.
        - Steps to reproduce the bug.
        - Expected and actual behavior.
        - Environment details (e.g., OS, browser, software version).

        ```md title=".github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md"
        ---
        name: Bug Report
        about: Report a bug to help us improve
        title: "[Bug] <Short description>"
        labels: bug
        ---

        **Describe the bug**
        A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

        **To Reproduce**
        Steps to reproduce the behavior:
        1. Go to '...'
        2. Click on '...'
        3. See error

        **Expected behavior**
        A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

        **Environment**
        - OS: [e.g., Windows 10]
        - Browser: [e.g., Chrome 92]
        - Version: [e.g., 1.2.3]
        ```

        <Aside type="tip" title="Reproducible environment">
        To help you save some time, you can ask contributors to provide a reproducible environment. This can be a specific version of the software, a particular browser, or any other relevant information.

        For the web projects, you can ask for a [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) link to demonstrate the issue.

        Better, you can provide pre-configured environments for contributors to start from in your documentation, or contributing guidelines.
        </Aside>

    </Steps>

    **Create a feature request template.**

    - Create another file in the same directory named `feature_request.md`.

      ```md title=".github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md"
      ---
      name: Feature Request
      about: Suggest a new idea for the project
      title: "[Feature] <Short description>"
      labels: enhancement
      ---

      **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
      A clear and concise description of what the problem is.

      **Describe the solution you'd like**
      A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

      **Additional context**
      Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.
      ```

    **Create a documentation update template.**

    - Similarly, create a `documentation_update.md` file.
    - Include fields for:
      - The affected section of documentation.
      - Suggested improvements.
      - Links or examples for clarification.

    <Aside type="tip" title="Tip of the iceberg">
    - You can remind contributors to search for existing issues before creating new ones.
    - You can remind contributors to follow the project's Code of Conduct.
    - You can link your contributing guidelines in each template.
    </Aside>

1. **Configure a central configuration file.**

    On top of having the template, you can also provide a `config.yml` file in the `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory to add extra information and guidance for contributors.

    ```yml title=".github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml"
    blank_issues_enabled: false
    contact_links:
      - name: Project Documentation
        url: https://your-docs-url.com
        about: Please check our documentation before creating an issue.
    ```

    This configuration disables blank issues, encouraging contributors to use the appropriate templates.

    It also provides a direct link to your project documentation, helping contributors resolve their questions or issues independently.

1. **Add labels for automatic categorization.**

    Use GitHub's labels to categorize issues automatically based on the templates used.

    **Set labels in the templates** to ensure each template assigns the correct label with the `labels` field in its metadata (see examples above).

    Labels like `bug`, `enhancement`, or `documentation` make it easier to triage issues and prioritize tasks.

    Use GitHub's settings to customize label colors and descriptions, making them more intuitive.

</Steps>

Designing specific issue templates is a small but impactful improvement for any Open Source project. It ensures contributors provide all necessary details upfront, making issue resolution faster and more effective. By guiding contributors through structured forms, you also lower the barrier for participation, encouraging more thoughtful engagement.

**Congratulations on completing this challenge!** Your project is now better equipped to handle diverse contributions while saving time and effort for maintainers. Keep refining your templates as your community grows.

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>

- ✓ Specific issue templates (e.g., bug report, feature request, documentation update) exist in your repository.
- ✓ A configuration file (e.g., `config.yml`) provides additional guidance for contributors.
- ✓ Templates include clear fields.
- ✓ Labels are automatically applied to issues based on the selected templates.

<hr />

Managing multiple repositories or a large one with contributors can become a daunting task, especially when issue reports lack structure or clarity. **Dynamic issue templates are a powerful way to guide contributors** in providing the information you need to address their concerns efficiently. By tailoring the issue submission process to different types of input, you reduce friction for contributors while ensuring that maintainers have all the context they need to act swiftly. GitHub's dynamic issue forms add flexibility and interactivity to the process, empowering you to use features like dropdowns or checkboxes.

**Today's challenge focuses on creating and implementing dynamic issue templates for your repositories.** Whether you're handling bug reports, feature requests, or other common issues, this task will help you build a standardized, user-friendly issue workflow that saves time for everyone involved. By the end of this challenge, you'll not only have functional issue forms but also a system that can be replicated or shared across multiple repositories for consistency.

<Steps>

1. **Review your existing issue template.**

    Before diving into dynamic forms, take a moment to evaluate your current setup.

    - Are you already using issue templates?
    - Maybe in Markdown?
    - If so, what types do you have (e.g., bug reports, feature requests)?

    Identify gaps in the information contributors typically provide. Look at the issues that often require follow-up questions—these are good candidates for improvement.

    Do the following for each repository:

    - Check if your `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory exists and contains templates.
    - If you don't have issue templates, check out the other challenges of the day to create them.
    - Consider aligning templates across repositories to provide a consistent experience.

1. **Create dynamic forms.**

    Dynamic issue templates are created using YAML files. They allow you to design interactive forms with fields like dropdowns or checkboxes.

    <Steps>

    1. Navigate to your `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory (create it if it doesn't exist).

    1. Create a new YAML file for a specific type of issue, such as `bug-report.yml`.

    1. Add fields that guide users to provide the necessary details:

        ```yml title=".github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yml"
        name: Bug Report
        description: Report a bug in the project
        title: "[Bug]: "
        labels: ["bug"]
        body:
          - type: markdown
            attributes:
              value: "Thank you for reporting a bug. Please provide the following details:"
          - type: input
            id: reproduction-steps
            attributes:
              label: Steps to reproduce
              description: "List the steps to reproduce the issue."
              placeholder: "Step 1: ..., Step 2: ..."
          - type: dropdown
            id: environment
            attributes:
              label: Environment
              description: "Select the environment where the issue occurs."
              options:
                - Development
                - Staging
                - Production
          - type: textarea
            id: logs
            attributes:
              label: Logs or Screenshots
              description: "Provide any logs or screenshots that may help identify the issue."
        ```

    1. Test your form by creating a new issue in your repository and selecting the template you just created.

    </Steps>

    <Aside>
    If you need help with the syntax, [learn more about issue templates](https://docs.github.com/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates).
    </Aside>        

1. **Standardize templates across repositories.**

    GitHub allows you to share issue templates across multiple repositories. If you have a standard set of templates you'd like to use in all your projects, or at least a default one, you can create a `.github` repository with the templates and then reference them in your other repositories.

    This can be done at the individual or organization level, ensuring consistency and reducing the effort required to maintain templates across multiple projects.

    [Learn more about default community health files](https://docs.github.com/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file#about-default-community-health-files).

</Steps>

**By completing this challenge, you've streamlined your project's issue-tracking system while providing contributors with a better user experience.** Dynamic forms reduce ambiguity, allowing maintainers to focus on resolving issues rather than requesting additional information. Standardizing templates across repositories ensures a unified workflow, saving time for both contributors and maintainers.

**Congratulations on enhancing the efficiency of your issue management process!** Remember, small improvements like these can significantly impact your project's success.

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>

- ✓ At least one repository now uses dynamic issue templates.
- ✓ Templates are tested and working as expected.
- ✓ Templates are standardized across repositories where applicable.
- ✓ Default community health files are used to share templates across multiple repositories.
