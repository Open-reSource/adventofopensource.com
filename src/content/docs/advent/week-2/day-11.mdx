<h2>The Chamber of Trials</h2>

The _Keeper of the Repos_ leads you to the _Chamber of Trials_, where the flames of the _Crucible of Validation_ blaze with unyielding intensity. This sacred forge is where creations are shaped and proven, tempered against the rigors they might face beyond the safety of the village.

In this chamber dwell the _Trialmasters_, skilled artisans who meticulously examine every detail of a craft. Their purpose is to uncover weaknesses and reinforce strengths, ensuring that each creation emerges resilient and dependable.

But the _Keeper_ cautions against the _Phantoms of Assumption_—insidious entities born from overlooked details. These specters thrive in the absence of preparation, threatening to unravel even the finest work. To safeguard the integrity of your craft, it must be honed and tested, its limits explored and its purpose affirmed.

Testing is a foundational practice for maintaining software quality and ensuring your code works as expected. **Writing tests allows you to catch bugs early**, verify that new features don't break existing functionality, and confidently refactor your code when needed. Additionally, automated tests provide a safety net for both you and other contributors, making collaboration easier and reducing the risk of introducing errors.

**Today's challenge is to write and run your first unit test**—a test that verifies the behavior of a single, isolated unit of code (such as a function or class). **You'll also take it a step further by automating your tests using GitHub Actions**, ensuring that your code is continuously tested whenever changes are made. By completing this challenge, you'll build a strong foundation for a robust and maintainable codebase.

<Steps>

1. **Choose a testing framework.**

    Identify the testing framework that best fits your tech stack. Common options include:
    - [Jest](https://jestjs.io), [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) or [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) (JavaScript)
    - [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de) (PHP)
    - [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) (Python)
    - [JUnit](https://junit.org/) (Java)

    If you're not sure which framework to choose, consult your stack's documentation or look for recommendations in your community. Most frameworks provide detailed setup instructions.

1. **Install the framework.**

    Follow the official documentation for your chosen framework to install it in your project. For example, to install Jest in a Node.js project, run:

    ```sh
    npm install --save-dev jest
    ```

    If your framework requires configuration (e.g., setting up a test folder or creating a config file), complete those steps as well.

1. **Write your first unit test.**

    Create a new file for your test, such as `tests/unit/example.test.js` (or similar name depending on your framework).

    Write a simple test for a function or class in your project, just to get started. For example, using Jest:

    ```javascript title="tests/unit/example.test.js"
    // Function to test
    function add(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    }

    // Unit test
    test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
      expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
    });
    ```

    <Aside type="tip" title="Tip of the iceberg">
    Start with something small and specific to get the hang of writing tests.
    </Aside>

1. **Run your test locally.**

    Run the test suite using the command specified in your framework's documentation. For Jest, you'd run:

    ```sh
    npx jest
    ```

    Verify that the test passes. If it doesn't, review the error message to identify the issue and adjust your test accordingly.

    **Congrats, you've written your first test! But let's go further!**

1. **Automate your tests with GitHub Actions.**

    <Steps>

    1. Create a new file called `.github/workflows/test.yml` in your project and set up a basic <abbr title="Continuous Integration">CI</abbr> workflow to automatically run your tests on every push.

    1. Dependending on your tech stack, the workflow will be different. But for inspiration, here's an example of a basic CI workflow:

        ```yaml title=".github/workflows/test.yml"
        name: 'Test'
        on:
          push:

        jobs:
          test:
            name: Test
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
              - name: Checkout
                uses: actions/checkout@v4

              - name: Set up Node.js
                uses: actions/setup-node@v4
                with:
                  cache: npm
                  node-version: 20

              - name: Install dependencies
                run: npm ci

              - name: Run tests
                run: npm run test
        ```

        Where `npm run test` would be the command to run your tests defined in your `package.json` as a script that runs your test suite.

        Adjust the workflow based on your tech stack. For example, if you're using Python, replace "Set up Node.js" with steps to set up Python and run tests using `pytest`.

    1. Commit the workflow file to your repository. On your next push, GitHub Actions will automatically run your tests.
    
    </Steps>

</Steps>

**Testing is an essential aspect of maintaining and scaling any Open Source project.** It ensures that your code behaves as expected, even as new features are added or contributors make changes. Without a proper test suite, bugs can remain unnoticed, potentially causing disruptions for users and other contributors. Creating a robust test suite not only improves the stability of your project but also boosts its credibility and appeal to potential contributors by fostering confidence in the codebase.

**Today's challenge is to create a complete test suite for your project**, covering critical functionality and ensuring that contributors can make changes with peace of mind. You will implement and organize different types of tests, create reusable test helpers, document your testing strategy, and set up a system for monitoring test performance and results. By the end of this challenge, your project will be more resilient, with a stronger foundation for growth and collaboration.

<Steps>

1. **Identify key areas to test.**

    Start by evaluating your project to identify its most critical features and functionality. These are the areas that users and contributors interact with most frequently and where failures would have the greatest impact. Key areas might include APIs, core business logic, or user interfaces.

    - **Critical path testing**: Focus on testing workflows or features that form the backbone of your application. For instance, if you're working on an e-commerce project, this could be the checkout process.
    - **Edge cases**: Think about less-common scenarios where things could go wrong, such as handling empty inputs, large files, or unexpected API responses.

    There's no need to test every single line of code, but you should aim to cover the most important parts of your project.

    There is a lot of litterature on the subject. Start at your own pace and level of comfort.

    You can start by reading [The Practical Test Pyramid by Ham Vocke](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html).

1. **Implement different types of tests.**

    A well-rounded test suite includes multiples test types, each serving a different purpose:

    - **Unit tests**: Validate individual components or functions. Use a testing library relevant to your stack, such as [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for JavaScript or [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) for Python.

        Example in JavaScript with Jest:

        ```javascript title="tests/unit/example.test.js"
        test('adds numbers correctly', () => {  
          expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5);  
        });
        ```

    - **Integration tests**: Test how different parts of your application work together. Ensure API endpoints return expected results or database queries function correctly. Tools like [SuperTest](https://github.com/ladjs/supertest) for Node.js or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) collections can be helpful here.
    - **End-to-End (E2E) tests**: Simulate real user behavior. Tools like [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) or [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) allow you to automate interactions across the entire application.
    - **Performance tests**: Identify bottlenecks in your code. Libraries like Lighthouse for web apps or [Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) for APIs can be valuable.
    - **Non-regression visual tests**: Ensure that the UI remains consistent across changes. Tools like [Percy](https://percy.io/) or [Applitools](https://applitools.com/) can help you catch visual regressions.
    - **Accessibility tests**: Verify that your application is accessible to all users. Tools like [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) or [Pa11y](https://pa11y.org/) can help you identify accessibility issues.
    - and more...

    <Steps>

    1. Evaluate the test types that best suit your project's needs and complexity.

    1. Install the environment and tools required for each test type.

    1. Create a least one test of each type to get started.

    1. Create scripts to run tests of each type separately or all together locally.

    1. Do the same thing for your CI pipeline.

    </Steps>

    You can always expand your test suite over time.


1. **Create reusable test helpers.**

    If you already have tests in your project, you might take some time to refactor them and extract common logic into reusable test helpers. This can help reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and make your tests more readable.

    For example, generating mock user data in JavaScript:

    ```javascript title="tests/helpers/user.js"
    function createMockUser(overrides = {}) {  
      return {  
        id: Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9),  
        name: 'Test User',  
        email: 'test@example.com',  
        ...overrides,  
      };  
    } 
    ```

    These helpers save time and improve consistency across your test suite.

1. **Document your testing strategy.**

    Documentation helps contributors understand your testing approach and how they can add their own tests.

    <Steps>

    1. Create a section in your contributing guidelines to explain:
        - The types of tests your project uses.
        - How to run tests locally and in the CI pipeline.
        - Guidelines for writing new tests, including preferred libraries or patterns.
        - Explain when to write new tests (e.g., for new features, bug fixes, or refactors).

    1. Update your pull request template to remind contributors to include tests with new features or bug fixes.

    </Steps>

1. **Set up test reporting and coverage analysis.**

    To track the effectiveness of your test suite, integrate tools that provide reports on test results and coverage.

    - **Test reporting**: many CI platforms like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI include built-in support for test reporting. You can also use services like [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) or [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) for detailed insights.
    - **Coverage analysis**: Coverage tools like [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) (JavaScript) or [Coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io) (Python) can show how much of your code is being tested and highlight gaps.

</Steps>

By creating a complete test suite, you've taken a major step toward making your project more robust, secure, and welcoming to contributors. Testing ensures that your application behaves as expected and minimizes the risk of bugs slipping through. Documenting your approach and automating reporting also makes it easier for others to maintain the project alongside you.

**Congratulations on completing this challenge!** With a solid testing foundation in place, your project is ready to handle new features and contributions with confidence.

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>

- ✓ Your project has a variety of tests covering unit, integration, and <abbr title="End-to-End">E2E</abbr> scenarios.
- ✓ Critical functionality and edge cases are well-tested.
- ✓ (Optional) Reusable test helpers are implemented to streamline the addition of new tests.
- ✓ Testing documentation is available and clear.
- ✓ Test reporting and coverage tools are set up to monitor the health of the test suite.

**Managing testing practices across multiple repositories can quickly become complex**, especially when working in a larger organization or maintaining several interdependent projects. Scaling your testing infrastructure ensures that your codebase remains robust as it grows, and that critical issues are identified early, even when changes span multiple repositories. A well-designed testing pipeline will allow for more consistent, efficient, and scalable quality checks, which ultimately improves collaboration and minimizes risks during development.

**Today's challenge focuses on scaling your testing practices across repositories.** You'll learn how to set up centralized test orchestration, enforce advanced quality gates, and automate testing workflows that span multiple repositories. By the end of this challenge, you'll have a testing strategy in place that can handle large-scale projects and ensure the stability and security of your entire codebase.

<Steps>

1. **Review and unify test types, coverage, and frameworks.**

    Before scaling your testing practices, it's important to ensure consistency in the types of tests, the level of coverage, and the testing frameworks used across repositories. Unifying the tools and practices will bring a common philosophy to your testing strategy and make the contributors and maitnainers more comfortable and efficient.

    Inconsistent testing practices can lead to redundant tests, missed edge cases, or failures due to incompatibilities between different testing libraries. This step will help you align your testing strategies across repositories to make scaling easier and more effective.

    - **Test types**: Ensure that all repositories use similar types of tests (unit, integration, E2E, etc.) to cover critical functionality when needed.
    - **Coverage levels**: Ensure that you have a clear coverage strategy for each repository. Decide what level of coverage is appropriate for each type of test (e.g., higher coverage for unit tests, lower coverage for end-to-end tests). Aim for a balance between thoroughness and maintainability, as 100% coverage can be excessive in some cases.
    - **Test frameworks**: Standardize on testing frameworks across repositories to simplify maintenance and tooling, and allow contributors to share knowledge and resources. Choose frameworks that are widely used and well-supported in your stack.
    
1. **Set up cross-repository test orchestration.**

    It is not mandatory for all projects and use cases, but if you have multiple repositories that depend on each other, you might want to set up a centralized test orchestration system. This system will allow you to run tests across repositories from a central location, ensuring that changes in one repository don't break functionality in another, and that all interdependent codebases are verified at once.

    You can use tools like [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to trigger workflows in other repositories by creating a centralized orchestration workflow in a central repo. Here's an example of how to trigger workflows across multiple repositories:

    ```yaml title="Centralized orchestration workflow"
    name: Cross-Repo Test Orchestration

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    jobs:
      orchestrate-tests:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Trigger Repository A Tests
            run: gh workflow run repo-a/test-suite
          - name: Trigger Repository B Tests
            run: gh workflow run repo-b/test-suite
    ```

    Alternatively, [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), or [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) also support cross-repository orchestration via multi-project pipelines. Explore these tools for more advanced use cases.

1. **Adopt shared testing utilities.**

    After having unified your testing tools and frameworks, consider creating shared testing utilities gathered in a shared testing library that can be used across repositories. These utilities can include common test helpers, fixtures, or mocks that simplify writing tests and ensure consistency across projects.

    **Create a shared test suite** by developing a common set of utility functions or base classes for common test scenarios, such as mocking network requests or validating certain business logic. Publish this as a package that can be included as a dependency in each repository.

    For example, if you're working with JavaScript, you could create a shared utility package containing functions like `mockApi()` or `createMockState()` and publish it to npm or GitHub Packages. This way, every repository can easily include the latest versions of the utilities.

1. **Establish advanced quality gates.**

    Get beyond basic test coverage thresholds by implementing more advanced quality gates that evaluate broader code health metrics. These gates help ensure that your code is not just functionally correct but also performing well and secure.

    - **Performance testing**: Use performance benchmarks to catch regressions early. Integrate tools such as [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) for web applications or custom performance scripts to monitor key metrics. These can be run automatically as part of your test suite.
    - **Flaky test detection**: Flaky tests are those that intermittently pass or fail, making them unreliable indicators of code quality. Use tools or develop custom scripts that monitor your test results and flag any flaky tests. By doing so, you can ensure that tests are consistently reliable.
    - **Security checks**: Integrate security testing as part of your pipeline. Use tools like [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) to scan for vulnerabilities in your application during testing or use a dependency scanning tool to catch known vulnerabilities in your dependencies.
    - **Accessibility checks**: Ensure your application is accessible to all users by integrating accessibility checks into your testing pipeline. Tools like [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) or [Pa11y](https://pa11y.org/) can help you identify and fix accessibility issues early in development.
    - **Code complexity analysis**: Monitor code complexity metrics like cyclomatic complexity or maintainability index to identify areas of your codebase that may be hard to maintain or refactor. Use tools like [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) or [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) to automate this analysis.

1. **Automate test impact analysis.**

    In large codebases, **it's inefficient to run all tests after every change**, especially if the change only affects a small portion of the code.
    
    Test impact analysis helps automate this process by running tests that are affected by recent changes, rather than all tests, speeding up your CI/CD pipelines.

    Consider using test impact analysis tools such as [diff-Cover](https://github.com/Bachmann1234/diff_cover) for Python or [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) for Java, which can intelligently determine which tests should run based on changes in the codebase.

</Steps>

By centralizing your testing practices and using advanced quality gates, you are ensuring a robust and scalable testing pipeline that can keep up with a growing project. This not only saves time but also improves the quality, security, and performance of your code across repositories. Automating these practices makes maintaining high code quality across multiple repositories more efficient and sustainable in the long run.

**Congratulations on taking this step to scale your testing practices!** By implementing these advanced techniques, you are setting your project up for better maintainability, fewer bugs, and a more streamlined development process across all repositories.

> Assumptions are the enemies of progress. In the _Chamber of Trials_, you will forge certainty from uncertainty, ensuring that your artifact not only works but thrives under any conditions. Refining is not just a tool; it is a shield against the unknown.

Prepare yourself, traveller, for each trial you inscribe strengthens the foundation of your artifact. Return tomorrow as the _Advent of Open Source_ continues, and the journey toward mastery unfolds.
