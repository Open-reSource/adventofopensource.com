**Managing an Open Source project becomes more complex as your first issues and contributions start to appear.** Defining a clear project direction and organizing tasks effectively are key steps to ensuring the project remains focused, efficient, and contributor-friendly.

The goal here isn't to become a professional project manager but to establish simple workflows that can scale as your project grows. Tools like milestones, project boards, and issue prioritization will help you keep everything on track.

**Today's challenge focuses on creating a foundation for project organization.** By defining clear goals, creating structured milestones, and visualizing progress through project boards, you'll not only manage tasks effectively but also set expectations for your contributors. A well-organized project attracts more contributions because it reduces confusion, highlights priorities, and shows a roadmap for the future.

<Steps>

1. **Define your short-term and medium-term goals.**

    Start by identifying where your project is headed in the next few weeks or months. Goals give direction and purpose to your work.

    - **What needs to be done?**: List specific tasks such as completing a feature, improving documentation, or adding translations.
    - **What does "success" look like?**: Define concrete success criteria such as "All installation steps are documented", or "Translation support is added for French".
    - **What's the timeline?**: Be realistic. Set deadlines that account for your availability, the complexity of each task, and your motivation or energy.

1. **Create issues to represent tasks.**

    Issues are the backbone of your project, acting as individual units of work. Each issue should represent a task or a feature to implement.

    - Use clear titles and detailed descriptions to explain what needs to be done.
    - Add relevant labels to categorize issues such as <Badge text="bug" />, <Badge text="enhancement" />, <Badge text="documentation" />, or <Badge text="feature" />.
    - Use checklists within issue descriptions to break down complex tasks into smaller steps.

    Everything gathered will form your backlog.

    To create an issue: Go to the _Issues_ tab, then click on _New Issue_. Add the details and relevant labels.

1. **Prioritize your issues.**

    Focus on what matters most. Not all tasks are equally urgent or important. Prioritizing your issues will help you stay focused and avoid getting overwhelmed.

    Go to the _Issues_ tab in your repository, and click on the _Labels_ section.
    
    Then, you can create labels by clicking on _New label_ such as <Badge text="priority: high" />, <Badge text="priority: medium" />, <Badge text="priority: low" />, and apply them to your issues. For each label, you'll need to define a name, a description, and a color.

1. **Create a project board.**

    A project board will help you to visualize task progress. A project board organizes issues into workflow stages, such as "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done".

    - Go to the _Projects_ tab in your repository, and click on _New project_. There are several ways to create a project board, but you can start with a simple board visualization.

    - Choose _Board_, set up the project name, and click on _Create project_.

    - By default, you'll have three columns: "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". You can add more columns by clicking on _Add column_.

    From this board, you can drag and drop issues to move them between columns, assign them to contributors, and track their progress. Or you can do it directly from the issues or pull requests by adding the project board to them.

1. **Set up a milestone.**

    Group issues with common goals that you want to achieve by a specific date. A milestone is a significant step towards your project's vision, tied to a deadline.

    - Go to the _Issues_ tab in your repository, and click on _Milestones_. Then, click on _New milestone_ and define:
      - A clear title (e.g., "Version 1.0 Release")
      - A description explaining the milestone's purpose
      - A target due date for completion
    - Assign issues to the milestone by editing the issue and selecting the milestone from the dropdown.

1. **Document your roadmap and goals.**

    Contributors will access the project board, the milestones, and the issues publicly. 

    In the `README.md` or in a dedicated file, publicly share your goals and roadmap can help current and future contributors understand what's being worked on and how they can help.

    A simple summary can be enough such as:

    ```
    ## Roadmap

    ### Current Milestone: v1.0

    - Complete core features (Deadline: Feb 28)
    - Improve documentation (Deadline: Feb 15)

    ### Project Board

    Track progress on our [Project Board](https://github.com/your-repo-name/projects/1).
    ```

    More details can be added in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, or a dedicated file.

</Steps>

From there, you'll need to keep your milestones and projects up to date:
- Reassign issues as needed to reflect shifting priorities
- Update the `README.md` to showcase new milestones or completed goals
- Use GitHub's Insights tab to monitor overall project progress

<Aside type="tip" title="Tip of the iceberg">
- **Start small**: Set one or two milestones and a handful of issues to get started. You can always add more as you go.
- **Engage the community**: Use GitHub Discussions to get feedback or ideas for future milestones.
- **Be transparent**: Keep goals realistic and communicate progress regularly.
</Aside>

**At this stage, your project will have a well-defined structure for managing goals, tracking progress, and staying organized.** Clear milestones and project boards improve transparency and motivate contributors by showing tangible progress. As you grow, these tools can scale to support more complex workflows and larger teams.

**Keeping your project organized isn't a one-time effort—it's a habit.** Regularly update your milestones, reassign tasks based on priority, and celebrate completed goals by sharing updates in your README or social media.

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>

- ✓ Short-term and medium-term goals defined.
- ✓ Backlog of issues created and prioritized.
- ✓ Project board set up.
