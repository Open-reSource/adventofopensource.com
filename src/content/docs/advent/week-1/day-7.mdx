<h2>Enter the Clocktower of Continuity</h2>

As the first week of the _Advent_ draws to a close, the _Keeper of the Repos_ summons the villagers to the towering _Clocktower of Continuity_. Its great gears and pendulums move in perfect harmony, marking the steady rhythm of collaboration. Yet the _Specters of Chaos_ loom nearby, whispering discord into the workings of the tower, threatening to stall its progress.

The _Keeper_ steps forward, their voice resolute:

> The strength of any creation lies in its rhythm. Without clear guidance and thoughtful action, even the most promising efforts falter.

The _Keeper_ gestures to the clocktower's gears, each turning in precise unison.

> To guard against the specters, we must weave discipline into our work. Let each action be intentional, each step secure, and each movement aligned with the whole. Only then can the rhythm endure, unbroken and true.

With determination, the villagers prepare to restore order, ensuring the clocktower's harmony continues undisturbed.

**As you've seen in the past few days, we've been using the GitHub interface to create files. Today, however, we're taking things a step further by introducing Git.**

Git is a **version control system** that allows you to track changes in your project, collaborate with others, and keep everything organized. It's the engine behind repositories on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and others.

Today's goal is simple: we'll guide you through the basic Git workflow so you can clone your repository, make changes locally, and push them back to your GitHub repository.

<Aside title="What if I know Git already?">
If you're already comfortable with Git, feel free to clone your repository now, skip these steps, and [jump to the final section of today's challenge](#final-paragraph).
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. **Getting started with Git.**

    If you haven't installed Git on your machine yet, don't worry—it's a quick process.

    Download it from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/), or use any package manager available on your system.

    Then, verify your installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running:

    ```sh
    git --version
    ```

    If a version number appears, you're all set!

1. **Cloning your GitHub repository locally.**

    <Steps>

    1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub, and click the _Code_ button, and copy the provided URL.

        <ContentImage src={day07Snowflake01} alt="" />

    1. In your terminal, navigate to the folder where you'd like to clone the repository, then run:

        ```sh
        git clone <URL>
        ```

        Replace `<URL>` with the URL you copied from GitHub. For instance:

        ```sh
        git clone git@github.com:Open-reSource/avalanche.git
        ```

    1. Once cloned, move into the repository's folder with:

        ```sh
        cd avalanche
        ```

    1. Check the repository's status with:

        ```sh
        git status
        ```

        You should see something like this:

        ```sh
        On branch main
        Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

        nothing to commit, working tree clean
        ```

    </Steps>

1. **Exploring your repository.**

    In previous days, we created files and directories using GitHub's interface. Let's look at the history of these actions:

    ```sh
    git log
    ```

    You'll see a list of commits, showing details like author, date, and commit messages.

1. **Adding files.**

    <Steps>

    1. Create a file named `hello-world.txt` using any text editor and write anything you like inside it.

    1. In your terminal, tell Git to track this file:

        ```sh
        git add hello-world.txt
        ```

    1. Commit your changes with a message. Remember when we created files on GitHub, we added a message? It's the same here:

        ```sh
        git commit -m "docs: add hello-world.txt"
        ```

    1. Push your changes from your local environment to your repository on GitHub:

        ```sh
        git push
        ```

        If this is your first push, Git may ask you to authenticate or set up your credentials. Follow the prompts to complete the process.

    1. Refresh your repository on GitHub—you should see the new file!

        You can do the same process for any file you want to add or modify. Just remember to always add, commit, and push your changes.

    </Steps>

1. **Removing files.**

    Let's say you don't need `hello-world.txt` anymore.

    <Steps>

    1. In your terminal, remove the file with:

        ```sh
        git rm hello-world.txt
        ```

    1. Commit and push the removal:

        ```sh
        git commit -m "docs: remove hello-world.txt"
        git push
        ```

    1. Your repository is now clean again!

    </Steps>

</Steps>

<hr />

Efficient use of Git is crucial for working effectively on complex, multi-contributor projects. While basic commands like `git status` or `git commit` are commonly used by every developer, mastering Git aliases can supercharge your workflow. Aliases let you customize and shorten commands, saving time and minimizing errors. Pairing this with tools like the GitHub CLI further enhances your ability to interact seamlessly with GitHub repositories.

Today's challenge is all about creating and using advanced Git aliases, both for Git and the GitHub CLI, to optimize your development process.

Let's dive into how these aliases can streamline your Git workflow and collaboration efforts on large projects.

<Steps>

1. **Understand Git aliases and their advantages.**

    Git aliases allow you to define shortcuts for frequently used commands, reducing repetitive typing and increasing productivity. For instance, instead of typing `git checkout <branch>` repeatedly, you can set up a shorter alias like `git co <branch>`.

    Aliases are stored in the `~/.gitconfig` file under the `[alias]` section. They can represent single commands, chained commands, or even custom scripts. Learn more in the [official Git documentation]([official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases)) or explore creative ideas from the [git-tips/tips GitHub repository](https://github.com/git-tips/tips).

1. **Set up custom Git aliases for common tasks.**

    Create aliases to simplify routine Git commands by running the following commands in your terminal. Once configured, these shortcuts are available in any repository:

    - `git co` for `git checkout`:

      ```sh
      git config --global alias.co checkout
      ```

    - `git br` for `git branch`:

      ```sh
      git config --global alias.br branch
      ```

    - `git st` for `git status`:

      ```sh
      git config --global alias.st status
      ```

    - `git lg` for a simplified, graphical representation of your commit history:

      ```sh
      git config --global alias.lg "log --oneline --graph --all --decorate"
      ```

    - `git amend` for amending your last commit without modifying the message:

      ```sh
      git config --global alias.amend "commit --amend --no-edit"
      ```

1. **Create advanced aliases to optimize workflows.**

    Take your efficiency to the next level by chaining multiple commands into single aliases. These compound aliases can handle common sequences of actions:

    - `git sync` for fetching, rebasing, and pushing changes in one step:

      ```sh
      git config --global alias.sync "!git fetch && git pull --rebase && git push"
      ```

    - `git delete-branch` for deleting the current branch after merging:

      ```sh
      git config --global alias.delete-branch "!git branch -d $(git branch --show-current)"
      ```

    - `git current` to display the active branch:

      ```sh
      git config --global alias.current "rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD"
      ```

1. **Integrate GitHub CLI for GitHub repository interactions.**

    The [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) integrates GitHub features directly into your terminal, making tasks like creating issues, managing pull requests, and more faster and easier.

    - Install the CLI by following the instructions on the [GitHub CLI website](https://cli.github.com/).

    - Use the CLI to create Git aliases for GitHub actions:

      - Create an issue:

        ```sh
        git config --global alias.create-issue "!gh issue create --title 'Bug Fix' --body 'Description of the issue'"
        ```

      - Checkout a pull request from a forked repository:

        ```sh
        git config --global alias.pr-checkout "!gh pr checkout"
        ```

1. **Share your aliases for team-wide benefits.**

    Sharing aliases can improve team efficiency, especially for project-specific workflows. You can document aliases in your project's README or contributing guidelines, a team wiki, or maintain them in a shared repository.

    **Got a favorite alias? Share it with us!** We'd love to see how you're enhancing your workflow.

</Steps>

By using Git aliases, you'll dramatically improve your Git proficiency, save time, and reduce manual errors. Combining this with GitHub CLI makes managing GitHub tasks effortless. Sharing these productivity boosters with collaborators ensures your entire team benefits, fostering a smoother and more efficient development process.

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>

- ✓ You've created custom Git aliases for common commands.
- ✓ You've configured advanced Git aliases to simplify workflows.
- ✓ You've installed and utilized GitHub CLI for GitHub interactions.
- ✓ (Optional) You've shared your aliases with us or your collaborators!

## Advanced: Optimize Branching Strategies

<hr />

<Lore type="ice">
In the shadow of the _Clocktower of Continuity_, a figure clad in flowing robes waits by a shimmering river. The waters twist and divide into countless streams, each weaving its own path before reuniting further downstream. The traveller is _Twych, The Guardian of Streams_, a keeper of order amidst the ever-shifting currents.

> These waters represent the flow of creation,

the _Guardian_ says, their voice calm and steady.

> Each stream must be guided with care, for chaotic currents can lead to discord and stagnation. But when the streams are harmonized, they carve a path to progress that is both steady and strong.

They hand you a silver staff, its surface engraved with intricate patterns.

> Take this. Learn to divide the currents wisely, ensuring each one flows with purpose. Align them to your vision, and you will tame the chaos, transforming it into harmony.

With a solemn nod, the _Guardian_ steps aside, leaving you to begin your work.

<hr />

**Branching strategies** form the backbone of efficient collaboration in Git, especially when managing large projects or working within teams. While foundational models like **Git Flow** or **Trunk-Based Development** provide a starting point, refining these strategies can help you scale workflows, maintain high-quality code, and minimize friction. Effective branching isn't just about choosing a model; it's about aligning it with tools like CI/CD pipelines and equipping contributors with advanced Git techniques.

Today's challenge invites you to evaluate and optimize your project's branching strategy to better match its size, complexity, and team structure.

<Steps>

1. **Evaluate your current branching strategy.**

    Understanding your starting point is key to making improvements. Reflect on these questions:
    - How many branches does your project currently use, and what is their purpose?
    - Are there long-lived branches, and why do they exist?
    - How are feature branches created and merged into the main branch?
    - Do you use release or hotfix branches?
    - What challenges or bottlenecks have arisen, such as frequent merge conflicts or slow reviews?
    - Is the branching model in use (e.g., Git Flow, Feature Branching, Trunk-Based Development) clearly documented and consistently followed?

    This evaluation will clarify your team's needs and uncover areas for improvement.

1. **Select or refine a branching model.**

    Based on your evaluation, decide whether to adopt a new model or optimize your current one.

    Three common branching models can be considered.

    - **Git Flow.**

      Ideal for projects with scheduled releases and clear versioning. Git Flow uses long-lived branches like `develop` and `main`, and organizes feature development, releases, and hotfixes into distinct workflows.

      Steps to implement Git Flow:

      - Use `develop` as the central branch for active development.
      - Create feature branches (e.g., `feature/my-feature`) from `develop`.
      - Prepare releases using dedicated release branches, merged back into both `main` and `develop`.
      - Address critical bugs using hotfix branches created directly from `main`.

      Explore more in Vincent Driessen's article: [A successful Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

    - **Feature branching.**

      Best for teams working on independent features. Contributors create separate branches for each feature, keeping `main` or `develop` clean.
    
      Steps to implement Feature Branching:

      - Create branches named after the feature (e.g., `feature/new-login`).
      - Rebase regularly to avoid conflicts when merging.
      - Merge branches into `main` or `develop` using Pull Requests (PRs) after review.

    - **Trunk-Based Development.**

      Ideal for fast-moving projects, this approach emphasizes direct commits to `main` with frequent integrations. Use feature flags to avoid exposing incomplete work.

      Steps to implement Trunk-Based Development:

      - Ensure contributors commit small, incremental changes to `main`.
      - Use feature flags to safely deploy unfinished features.
      - Employ robust CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

1. **Integrate CI/CD to enforce branching rules.**

    Automation can ensure consistency and streamline your workflow. Examples include:

    - **Branch protection rules** to restrict direct commits to critical branches. On GitHub, you can read more about [Branch protection rule](https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule).
    - **Automated testing** to run unit tests, integration tests, and other checks on each pull request before merging.
    - **Code quality checks** to ensure that code quality standards are met before merging using tools like [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/), [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/), or [SonarQube](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/).
    - **Deployment pipelines** to deploy changes to staging or production environments automatically.
    - ... and any other CI/CD practices that can help optimize your branching strategy such as linting, code formatting, or security checks.

    Tailor these practices to suit your team's workflow and technical requirements.

1. **Train your team in advanced Git techniques.**

    Not all contributors may be familiar with advanced Git commands, which are essential for efficient collaboration. Provide resources or training sessions on:

    - **Rebase** to keep commit histories clean and avoid unnecessary merge commits.
    - **Cherry-pick** to selectively apply changes from one branch to another.
    - **Squash commits** to maintain a linear and readable history.

    Establishing team-wide agreements on rebase vs. merge strategies ensures consistency. These decisions can be enforced in the GitHub repository settings.

1. **Continuously monitor and adjust.**

    A branching strategy is not static; it evolves with your project. Regularly review your workflow to ensure it still meets the project's needs and make adjustments based on team feedback or technical challenges.

</Steps>

An optimized branching strategy ensures smooth collaboration, reduces conflicts, and accelerates development cycles. Coupled with automation through CI/CD and advanced Git techniques, your team can achieve a scalable and efficient workflow.

By refining your strategy and aligning it with your team's needs, you build a strong foundation for consistent, high-quality contributions—critical for both large teams and Open Source projects.

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>

- ✓ You've evaluated your current branching strategy.
- ✓ (Optional) You've refined a branching model (e.g., Git Flow, Feature Branching, or Trunk-Based Development).
- ✓ You've integrated CI/CD practices to automate and enforce branching rules.
- ✓ (Optinal) You've planned training sessions to upskill team members in advanced Git techniques or to create resources for self-learning.
