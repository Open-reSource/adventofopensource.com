<h2>The Labyrinth of Lost Artifacts</h2>

Deep within the _Winter Open Source Village_ sprawls the tangled _Labyrinth of Lost Artifacts_, a confounding maze where scattered creations and jumbled designs have led many artisans astray. The _Keeper of the Repos_ stands at the entrance, their expression grave yet hopeful.

> The labyrinth feeds on disorder,

they explain, their voice echoing through the twisting corridors.

> Even the most brilliant ideas are vulnerable here if they lack strong roots and a clear path forward.

As the artisans exchange nervous glances, the _Village Cartographer_ steps forward, holding a map that seems unfinished, its lines fading into uncertainty.

> A map is only as good as its clarity,

they add,

> and a well-laid foundation can serve as the guide to any who follow.

The challenge before you is clear: to create a structure that is intuitive and enduring, one that will guide others through the maze with confidence. Whether your artifact is small or sprawling, a strong framework will ensure its treasures remain accessible, and its purpose shines through the fog of confusion.

With determination, you take the first steps into the labyrinth, ready to tame its chaos and turn its winding paths into an enduring legacy.

Organizing your project with clear and purposeful directories lays the groundwork for maintainability and scalability. While conventions may vary depending on the project type or programming language, adopting a structured approach can improve collaboration and ease of navigation.

Today's challenge is to set up a basic folder structure for your project, defining essential directories that will guide contributors and maintainers through the repository with clarity.

<Steps>

1. **Define the main directories** your project will need.

    Each type of project or language used may have different conventions, so choose conventions that fit your project's nature and team preferences.

    Common top-level folders include:
    - `/src` or `/app` for source code
    - `/docs` for documentation
    - `/tests` for testing
    - `/config` for configuration files
    - `/assets` for static files as images or stylesheets
    - `/build` or `/dist` for compiled or built files (if applicable)

2. **Create the directories** in your repository.

    GitHub doesn't allow the creation of empty directories. Instead of adding placeholder files, the convention is to use `.gitkeep` files, which ensure directories are included in version control.

    Let's define and create the following structure in your project:
    
    <FileTree>

    - assets
      - .gitkeep
    - config
      - .gitkeep
    - dist
      - .gitkeep
    - docs
      - .gitkeep
    - src
      - .gitkeep
    - tests
      - .gitkeep
    - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
    - LICENSE
    - README.md

    </FileTree>

    If your project needs specialized directories, adapt this structure to include additional folders, or remove those that are not relevant.

    <Aside type="tip" title="Explore other repositories">
    Look at other projects in your programming language or domain to see how they structure their repositories. This can give you ideas for your own project.
    </Aside>

    To create these directories on GitHub:
    
    <Steps>
    
    1. **Create a new file for each directory.**
    
        - Click the _Add file_ button.
        - Select _Create new file_.
        - Enter the directory name followed by `/` and `.gitkeep`. For example, for the assets directory, type `assets/.gitkeep`.

        <ContentImage src={day05Snowflake01} alt="" />

    1. **Commit your changes.**
    
        - Click on the _Commit changes..._ button
        - Enter ``chore: add `assets` directory`` as a commit message.
        - Click on the _Commit changes_ button.

    1. **Verify your directory structure.**

        Navigate back to your repository's main page to confirm the new folders are visible.

        You'll see your structure neatly organized and ready for further development.

        <ContentImage src={day05Snowflake02} alt="" />

    </Steps>

</Steps>

The folder structure you created today will serve as the foundation for your project, making it easier for contributors and maintainers to navigate. Establishing these directories early helps ensure your repository stays organized and accessible.

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>

- ✓ All specified directories are created in your project.
- ✓ Each directory is visible in the GitHub repository, thanks to `.gitkeep` files.

A well-structured repository is the backbone of any successful project, ensuring that contributors can navigate, understand, and build upon your work with ease. As your project grows, maintaining a clear and modular organization becomes crucial for scalability, collaboration, and long-term maintainability. This challenge guides you through refactoring your repository to achieve a structure that reflects the logical flow of your project, whether it's software, documentation, or other assets.

Today's challenge is to refactor and optimize your repository structure, grouping related items, enhancing clarity, and setting the stage for seamless collaboration.

Refactoring might seem like a small step, but it can have a huge impact on your project's long-term success and contributor engagement. Take the time to refine your repository today—it's an investment in clarity, scalability, and collaboration.

<Steps>

1. **Assess the current structure.**

    Start by reviewing your current repository structure. Identify areas where files are scattered or where the structure lacks logical groupings.

    - **For software projects**: Check if components, services, or utilities are organized logically or if related files are scattered across multiple folders.
    - **For documentation projects**: Evaluate whether different types of content (e.g., tutorials, guides, reference material) are mixed in ways that make navigation cumbersome.
    - **For design or other creative repositories**: Look for opportunities to organize assets like icons, layouts, or typography into clear categories.

1. **Define core areas and logical divisions.** 

    Identify the main features, domains, or content** areas of your project. This could be functionalities (in a software project), sections or topics (in documentation), or other logical divisions of your content.

    In a code repository, this might involve grouping related components, services, utilities, or modules together, or separating the documentation from the codebase.
    
      Here's an example of how you might structure a code repository:

      <FileTree>

      - project
        - config/
        - dist/
        - docs/
        - src/
        - scripts/
        - tests/

      </FileTree>

1. **Group files per function or domain.**

    Once you have a clear idea of the core areas, reorganize your files into dedicated folders or modules based on their purpose. This keeps related files together, making it easier to locate items and understand their role in the project.

    For code repositories:

    <FileTree>

    - src
      - components/
      - utils/
      - services/
      - styles/

    </FileTree>

    For non-code projects such as documentation:

    <FileTree>

    - docs
      - about/
      - getting-started/
      - examples/
      - reference/
      - tutorials/

    </FileTree>
      
1. **Simplify deeply nested structures.**

    Avoid over-complicating your repository with excessive nesting, which can confuse contributors. Aim for a flatter structure that balances organization with accessibility.

1. **Consolidate configuration and script files.**

    Place all configuration files (e.g., `.eslintrc`, `webpack.config.js`) in a dedicated config/ directory, or keep them at the root level for accessibility. Similarly, move script files to a `scripts/` directory to separate them from the main source code.

1. **Update documentation.**

    Reflect the changes in your project's README or other documentation. Provide an overview of the new structure, explaining the purpose of each folder and how contributors should use them.

    - Update your `CONTRIBUTING` guide if applicable, to include instructions on navigating the new structure.
    - Consider creating a dedicated section or file that maps out the repository.

1. **Test and iterate.**

    Put you in the shoes of a new contributor navigating the repository. Ensure the new structure is intuitive, everything is functional, and no files are misplaced. Gather feedback from peers or contributors to identify areas for improvement.

    <Aside type="tip">
    Ask a colleague or friend unfamiliar with your project to test the structure and share their impressions.
    </Aside>

</Steps>

By refactoring your repository, you ensured that your project remains scalable, accessible, and welcoming to contributors. A well-organized structure not only saves time but also promotes clarity and collaboration, laying the groundwork for future growth.

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>

- ✓ Repository structure is optimized for modularity and clarity.
- ✓ Related files are grouped together in dedicated folders.
- ✓ Configuration and script files are organized in dedicated folders.
- ✓ Documentation is updated to reflect the new structure.
- ✓ Repository is tested and reviewed for usability and clarity.

As Open Source projects expand, maintaining clarity across multiple repositories or a large mono-repo becomes critical. A scalable structure supports efficient collaboration, simplifies maintenance, and allows contributors to quickly locate and work on specific areas. This challenge focuses on organizing repositories for scalability, whether you're managing a large mono-repo or multiple interconnected repositories.

Today's challenge is to create or enhance a scalable structure for your repository (or repositories) by implementing tools, defining clear relationships, and promoting maintainability.

<Steps>

1. **Evaluate your project's scope and structure.**

    Start by analyzing the current state of your repository or repositories.

    Ask yourself:
    - Is it a mono-repo (one repository housing all modules or components)?
    - Is it a multi-repo (separate repositories for related projects)?
    - Does the structure accommodate future growth (e.g., new features, components, or projects)?

    <Aside type="tip" title="Mono-repos?">
    If you're unfamiliar with mono-repos or unsure if they suit your project, [monorepo.tools](https://monorepo.tools/) contains elements to understand mono-repos, and the tools to build them.
    </Aside>

    By the end of this step, you should be able to answer questions like:
    - Is my current structure scalable and maintainable?
    - Am I using the right organizational approach for my project?

1. **Set up or optimize a scalable mono-repo.**

    If you use (or want to try) a mono-repo structure, consider the following:

    - **Adopt tools** like [Nx](https://nx.dev/) or [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to manage dependencies, builds, and module interactions.
    - **Define clear folder hierarchies** to separate domains or features (e.g. `apps/`, `libs/`).
    - **Leverage automation** to streamline tests, builds, and updates across modules. Tools like GitHub Actions or a dedicated CI/CD pipeline can help.

1. **Streamline multi-repo projects.**

    If you manage multiple repositories, ensure clarity and cohesion across them:

    - **Document relationships** between repositories. Use a shared resource like a README, wiki, or a dedicated repository to map dependencies and workflows.
    - **Centralize shared resources** in a dedicated repository. This might include shared libraries, templates, or APIs.
    - **Synchronize changes across repositories** using automation tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or specialized scripts.

1. **Introduce ownership and responsibility**

    For repositories with multiple maintainers or overlapping domains, clearly defined ownership is important:

    - **Create teams** or groups in your Git hosting platform to assign maintainers to specific repositories or modules. This enables efficient issue triaging, pull request reviews, and direct collaboration.
    - **Use a `CODEOWNERS` file** to designate responsibility for specific areas of the repository, specific folders or files.

      A `CODEOWNERS` file to assign ownership for different parts of the repository to some teams could look like this:

      ```plaintext title="CODEOWNERS"
      /frontend/ @frontend-team
      /backend/ @backend-team
      /libs/shared-components/ @shared-library-team
      ```

      Read more [about code owners and its `CODEOWNERS` file](https://docs.github.com/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners).

    - **Clarify responsibilities** for reviewers and maintainers, especially in repositories with overlapping domains.

1. **Document your repository structure.**

    Documentation is vital for contributors and maintainers to understand the repository's structure, relationships, and rules.

    - For single repositories, the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file can outline folder purposes, tools, and workflows.
    - For complex environments, you can use a centralized resource like a wiki or a dedicated repository to document the relationships between repositories, the tools, people, and workflows.

    Refer back to [Day 3's challenge](/advent/week-1/day-3#advanced-create-a-readme-ecosystem-mapping) if you've already built an ecosystem mapping.

1. **Evaluate and iterate regularly.**

    A scalable structure is not static; it should evolve with your project's growth and community needs. Regularly review and refine:
    - Folder hierarchies
    - Automation tools
    - Shared libraries or resources
    - Roles and responsibilities

    Gather feedback from contributors and maintainers to address pain points or inefficiencies. For smaller projects, GitHub's Insights can provide engagement data. For larger or more complex projects, consider adopting an internal governance model to coordinate resources and workflows.

</Steps>

Through this challenge, you have analyzed your repository's scalability, streamlined its structure for maintainability, and implemented tools and practices to enhance collaboration. Whether by organizing a mono-repo, clarifying relationships in multi-repos, or defining roles and documentation, your efforts have laid a solid foundation for your project's long-term growth and adaptability.

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>

- ✓ Repository structure is optimized for scalability and maintainability.
- ✓ Mono-repo or multi-repo setup is streamlined and documented.
- ✓ Ownership and responsibility are clearly defined for maintainers and contributors.
- ✓ Documentation is updated to reflect the new structure and relationships.
- ✓ Repository structure is reviewed and refined based on feedback and project growth.
