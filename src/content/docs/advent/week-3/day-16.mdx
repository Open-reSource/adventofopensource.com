<h2>The Scrolls of Enlightenment</h2>

The _Keeper_ guides you into the towering halls of the _Tome of Knowledge_, a sprawling library whose shelves stretch endlessly into the sky. Here, the wisdom of countless journeys is meticulously recorded, preserved for those who seek to follow the paths of others. At the heart of this grand sanctuary stands the _Archivist of Clarity_, a serene figure whose every movement seems to bring order to the labyrinthine rows of tomes.

> Within these walls, all who seek understanding must find a guiding light,

the _Archivist_ explains, gesturing toward the shelves.

> Yet, beware the _Maze of Obscurity_, where confusion reigns and clarity fades. It is a place where seekers wander in circles, unable to find the answers they need.

Their gaze sharpens, filled with purpose.

> To prevent this, we must tend to the records, ensuring that each volume holds not only knowledge but also guidance—a beacon for those who come after.

**When someone discovers your Open Source project, their first experience often depends on how easily they can install and start using it.** A clear installation guide not only makes your project approachable but also signals that you care about your users' journey. A well-structured installation guide reduces confusion, minimizes questions, and improves adoption rates, especially for non-technical users.

**Today's challenge is to create an installation guide** tailored for your end users—those who will be consuming your software or content. This differs from contributor guidelines, which focus on the technical setup contributors might need. Today's challenge ensures that anyone, regardless of technical expertise, can use your project without hassle.

The installation guide should reside in the `README.md` file of your project for now, as it's the first place users will look for guidance while you don't have any website or documentation platform set up.

<Aside type="tip" title="Tip of the iceberg">
If your project is complex to use or targets a diverse use base, you may later move this guide to a dedicated `INSTALL.md` or documentation website to keep things more organized. In this case, you'll still want to have a quick start guide in your `README.md` pointing to the full installation guide.
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. **Open your `README.md` file.**

    Start by editing your project's `README.md` file. This is the go-to document for most users seeking guidance.

1. **Add a section titled "Installation", "Quick start", or "Getting Started".**

    Include a dedicated section for installation instructions. Choose a clear and inviting title like "Getting Started", "Quick Start", or simply "Installation".

1. **(Optional) List prerequisites.**

    Clearly outline any software, hardware, or environment requirements that users need before installing your project. This helps prevent confusion or failed installations.

    ```md title="README.md"
    ## Quick Start

    ### Prerequisites

    - A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
    - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for running a pre-configured environment)
    - Or a platform-specific runtime:
      - Node.js v16.0 or higher (for manual installation)
    ```

1. **Explain installation methods.**

    Provide clear instructions for how users can install your project. These could include one or more methods based on your project type. Each method should be described concisely.

    - **Option 1: Download and run.**
    
      If you provide binaries, a pre-built package, or an installer.

      ```md title="README.md"
      ## Quick Start

      1. Download the latest release from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Open-reSource/avalanche/releases).
      2. Extract the files or run the installer. 
      3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.
      ```

    - **Option 2: Install via package manager.**:
    
      If your project is distributed via npm, pip, or any other package manager.

      ````md title="README.md"
      ## Quick Start

      Run the following command in your terminal:
      
      ```sh
      npm install -g your-package-name
      ```
      ````

    - **Option 3: Run with Docker.**
    
      For users who prefer containerized setup.

      ````md title="README.md"
      ### Run with Docker

      1. Pull the latest Docker image:

        ```sh
        docker pull your-username/your-project
        ```

      2. Start the container:

        ```sh
        docker run -p 8080:8080 your-username/your-project
        ```
      ````

1. **Provide usage instructions.**

    Guide users on how to start using your project right after installation. This can be a simple command to run, a link to open in the browser, or any other action they need to take such as creating accounts, configuration files, setting up databases, and so on.

    ````md title="README.md"
    ## Quick Start

    <!-- Your content here... -->

    ### Usage

    1. Run the following comment to start the application:

      ```sh
      your-app-command
      ```

    2. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

      Follow the setup wizard to create your account and configure the app.

      From there, you can explore the main features:
      - Create new documents
      - Collaborate with other users
    ````
      
1. **(Optional) Add troubleshooting and FAQs.**

    Include a dedicated troubleshooting and FAQs section outside of the _Quick start_ section to address common issues and provide solutions in simple language. This reduces frustration for new users.

    ````md title="README.md"
    ## Quick Start

    <!-- Content from previous parts. -->

    ## Troubleshooting

    - **App doesn't start:** Ensure you are using the correct version of Node.js. Run `node -v` to check.
    - **Port already in use:** If you see an error about port 3000, try running:

      ```sh
      your-app-command --port 3001
      ```

    ## FAQs
    
    - **Q: Can I install this on Windows?**  
      A: Yes! The app works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    ````

</Steps>

Your installation guide doesn't have to be perfect from the start—it will evolve as your project grows and user feedback rolls in. However, having a clear and user-friendly guide early on demonstrates that you value accessibility and usability.

Remember to keep it simple and to the point—your users will thank you!

When contributors or users approach your project, a comprehensive and accessible installation process is often their first impression. **A well-documented installation guide that supports multiple environments—such as Windows, macOS, and Linux—can significantly enhance your project's usability and attract a broader audience.** By addressing platform-specific nuances and offering clear guidance, you reduce friction for potential contributors and users, empowering them to start quickly and with confidence.

**Today's challenge is to review and expand your project's installation guide to ensure it supports multiple environments and dependency managers.** You'll create platform-specific instructions, provide troubleshooting tips, and even automate the installation process to make it seamless. This effort not only improves the user experience but also strengthens the foundation for future contributors who rely on a clear and straightforward setup.

<Steps>

1. **Audit your installation guide.**

    Start by evaluating the current state of your installation guide to identify areas for improvement.

    <Steps>

    1. **Locate your installation guide.**

        - Check if your installation guide is part of the `README.md`, a dedicated `INSTALL.md` file, or within your project's documentation.
        - Ensure the guide includes a basic overview of requirements (e.g., language runtimes, libraries, tools).

    1. **Evaluate coverage.**

        - Does your guide currently address all major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)?
        - Are dependency managers (e.g., npm, pip, Homebrew, apt) supported for easier installation?

    1. **Identify missing steps.**

        - Test the installation process on at least two different environments.
        - Note any missing details, ambiguous steps, or platform-specific challenges that need clarification.

    </Steps>

1. **Expand platform-specific instructions.**

    Providing targeted instructions for each platform ensures users have a smooth installation experience.

    <Steps>

    1. **Add detailed steps for each platform.**

        If your project has platform-specific requirements or installation steps, include them in your guide such as:

        - **Windows**: Include details about environment variables, PowerShell commands, or installer options. If needed, suggest tools like [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) for package management.
        - **macOS**: Highlight compatibility with macOS versions, and consider Homebrew for dependencies.
        - **Linux**: Provide instructions for common distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch) and commands for package managers like `apt`, `yum`, or `pacman`.

        Adapt this example to specificities of your project. It could be package managers (e.g., npm, pnpm, Yarn, pip), APIs compatibility, deployment platforms, etc.

    1. **Create tables or separate sections.**:

    </Steps>

1. **Automate the installation process.**

    Automation simplifies the setup and minimizes user error, especially for complex environments.

    <Steps>

    1. **Create setup scripts.**

        - Write a `setup.sh` script for Unix-based systems that installs dependencies, sets environment variables, and performs basic configuration checks.

            ```sh title="setup.sh"
            #!/bin/bash  
            echo "Installing dependencies..."  
            sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y required-package  
            echo "Setup complete!"  
            ```

        - Use `batch` files or PowerShell scripts for Windows systems to achieve similar automation.
        - Use `brew` or `choco` commands for macOS and Windows respectively to install dependencies.
        
        <Aside type="tip" title="Add some nice colors">
        You can use color codes to make your scripts more visually appealing and easier to read. For example, you can use `echo -e "\e[32mInstalling dependencies...\e[0m"` to print a green message, or use a library like [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) in Node.js.
        </Aside>

    1. **Use cross-platform tools.**

        Explore tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Puppet](https://puppet.com/), or [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) for more complex setups that require configuration management.

    1. **Add instructions for running scripts.**

        Clearly explain how to execute these scripts in the installation guide (e.g., “Run bash `setup.sh` in your terminal”).

    </Steps>

1. **Provide troubleshooting tips.**

    Anticipating common issues saves users time and frustration.

    <Steps>

    1. **List common errors and fixes.**

        - If an installation step fails, describe likely causes (e.g., missing dependencies, incorrect permissions).
        - Offer practical solutions or links to resources.

    1. **Platform-Specific Troubleshooting.**

        For example:

        - **Windows**: Address common PowerShell errors or file permissions issues.
        - **macOS**: Mention potential problems with Gatekeeper blocking scripts and how to bypass them.
        - **Linux**: Include fixes for dependency conflicts or missing libraries.

    </Steps>
