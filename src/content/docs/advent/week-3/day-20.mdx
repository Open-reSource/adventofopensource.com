**Your Open Source project, much like a living organism, will evolve over time.** It may gain more contributors, see increased usage, or even shift its focus. Understanding the key metrics of your repository allows you to monitor this growth, assess engagement, and make data-driven decisions to improve your project. Metrics provide insights into your project's health, its community's activity, and its impact across the ecosystem.

**Today's challenge is to explore the _Insights_ tab of your repository** and familiarize yourself with the most relevant metrics available. 

Let's learn how to access and understand key metrics for your repository, and use them to monitor activity, engagement, and project health. By learning how to interpret this data, you'll gain a better understanding of your repository's dynamics and how to maintain its momentum over time.

<Steps>

1. **Explore the Insights tab.**

    Navigate to the _Insights_ tab in your repository to access a wealth of metrics that GitHub provides.

    Here are some key sections you can explore:
    - **Pulse**: Offers a summary of recent activity, including issues, pull requests, and releases over a defined time period.
    - **Contributors**: Displays a list of contributors along with their commit count and additions/deletions over time.
    - **Community Standards**: Dynamically tracks the repository's community standards files.
    - **Commits**: Visualizes the number of commits per day, helping you track coding activity.
    - **Code frequency**: Highlights trends in additions and deletions to your codebase.
    - **Dependency graph**: Reveals the dependencies your project relies on and the projects that depend on yours.
    - **Network**: Offers a timeline of commits and forks, showing activity across the repository's network.
    - **Forks**: Provides a list of forks and shows who is working with your repository.
    - **Action Usage Metrics**: A summary of the repository's action usage metrics, including the number of actions, minutes, and runs.
    - **Action Performance Metrics**: (if using GitHub Actions): Displays the number of workflow runs, total action usage time, and performance details.

    <Aside type="tip" title="Tip of the iceberg">
    To gain a better understanding, **explore metrics in active repositories with large communities**, such as [Astro's Insights](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pulse). These repositories offer an excellent example of how dynamic metrics can become as your project grows.
    </Aside>

    These metrics can help you understand the health of your project, the level of engagement from the community, and the impact of your project.

    Take your time, explore the different metrics, and familiarize yourself with the data available.

2. **Zoom in: community standards.**

    The _Community Standards_ section evaluates your repository's adherence to some Open Source best practices. It lists essential files such as:

    - **Contributing Guidelines**: Outlines how others can contribute to your project (`CONTRIBUTING.md` file).
    - **Security Policy**: Describes how to report vulnerabilities (`SECURITY.md` file).
    - **Accept content reports**: Ensures the repository allows reporting of content issues (enabled in settings).

    While we've covered most of these files in earlier challenges, today is about recognizing this checklist as a guide to improving your repository over time.

    <ContentImage src={day20Snowflake01} alt="" />

    Let's not tackle the missing files today (if any), but it's important to know about this section to refer to it later. It's a good checklist to ensure your repository meets the standards of the Open Source community.

3. **Understand the _Used by_ Section.**

    For repositories with a published package (e.g., npm, PyPI), GitHub may display a _Used by_ section on the repository's sidebar. This section showcases the number of public repositories that depend on your project. While this may not apply to your project right now, it's valuable to understand what it signifies:
    - It's a strong indicator of how widely your project is adopted.
    - It appears only if the dependency graph is enabled and more than 100 repositories depend on your project.

    If you're working on a library, plugin, or other reusable code, the _Used by_ section becomes a motivating metric as your project gains traction in the community.

</Steps>

**By understanding repository metrics, you gain a clearer picture of how your project is progressing.** Insights like traffic, contributions, and dependencies provide actionable data that can guide your next steps. As your project grows, these metrics will become even more valuable for identifying areas to improve and celebrating successes.

Metrics aren't just numbers—they're a reflection of the energy, effort, and enthusiasm that you and your contributors bring to your project. Use this information to foster growth and collaboration within your community.

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>

**Managing multiple repositories in an Open Source ecosystem can be challenging, especially when trying to understand the overall health and contributions across projects.** Metrics such as stars, forks, open issues, pull request trends, and contributor activity are valuable indicators of a project's growth, engagement, and sustainability. Monitoring these metrics across repositories can help identify areas that need attention, recognize contributors, and plan future development effectively.

**Today's challenge focuses on building a consolidated system to monitor metrics across repositories.** You will aim to create a dashboard that aggregates data from your repositories, providing you with a clear overview of their activity and health. You'll also learn how to set up alerts for anomalies, such as declining activity or dependency vulnerabilities, empowering you to address issues proactively.

<Steps>

1. **Plan your metrics and data sources.**

    Decide which metrics are important for your repositories.

    <Steps>

    1. **Identify key metrics.**

        Decide which metrics are important for your repositories. Common repository-oriented examples include:
        - Stars and forks to measure popularity and community interest.
        - Open issues and pull requests to track activity and health.
        - Number of active contributors over time.
        - Dependency vulnerabilities to ensure security.

        For example, you might want to monitor the average time to close an issue or merge a pull request to gauge responsiveness.

        But you can also get other metrics around performance, responsiveness, or community engagement based on external tools.

    1. **Understand your data sources.**

        Most of the repository-oriented metrics can be retrieved using the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/rest) or [GitHub GraphQL API](https://docs.github.com/graphql). Explore endpoints like `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/stats/contributors` for contributor stats or `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues` for issue tracking.

        Some other can be retrieved from external tools, having their own APIs or integrations.

    </Steps>

1. **Build your dashboard.**

    Create a centralized dashboard to visualize metrics across your repositories. This dashboard should provide a comprehensive view of your projects' activity, health, and engagement.

    <Steps>

    1. **Set up a data retrieval script.**

        Use a programming language like JavaScript, Python, or any preferred stack to fetch metrics from the different APIs available. For instance, in Node.js, you can use libraries like [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit) to interact with the GitHub API:

        ```javascript
        const octokit = new Octokit();

        // Compare: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos/#list-organization-repositories
        octokit.rest.repos
          .listForOrg({
            org: "octokit",
            type: "public",
          })
          .then(({ data }) => {
            // handle data
          });

    1. **Aggregate metrics.**

        Combine the data from different sources or repositories into a single dataset (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) or a simple JSON file if the data size is small enough.

        Use a scheduler like `cron` or GitHub Actions to periodically update metrics for all repositories in your organization or personal account.

    1. **Visualize data.**

        Create a dashboard using tools like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/), or build a custom front-end using charting libraries like [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) or [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org).

        Display metrics in charts, tables, and graphs. For example, plot a trendline of new contributors over time or a pie chart showing the ratio of resolved to unresolved issues.

    </Steps>

1. **Automate alerts for anomalies.**

    Set up automated alerts to notify you of anomalies or critical issues across your repositories. This proactive approach helps you address problems promptly and maintain the health of your projects.

    <Steps>

    1. **Define anomalies.**

        Determine what constitutes an anomaly for each metric. For instance, the following examples could be considered anomalies:
        - A sudden drop in stars
        - A sharp decline in contributor activity
        - A sudden spike in unresolved issues
        - Newly introduced dependency vulnerabilities

    1. **Set up automated alerts.**

        Use GitHub Actions to monitor metrics and send alerts to Slack, email, or other channels.

        For example, use a script to compare weekly contributor counts, and trigger an alert if the number drops below a threshold.
    
    1. **Add security alerts.**

        Integrate tools like [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) or [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) to monitor dependency vulnerabilities automatically.

    </Steps>

1. **Create and share reports.**

    Generate periodic reports summarizing the health and activity of your repositories. Share these reports with your team to keep them informed and engaged.

    <Steps>

    1. **Generate periodic reports.**

        Use GitHub Actions or a similar automation tool to generate weekly or monthly reports summarizing the health and activity of your repositories.

        Include key metrics, trends, and insights in these reports to provide a comprehensive overview.

    1. **Share reports with your team.**

        Share reports with your team members or contributors to keep them informed about the project's progress and areas that need attention.

        Consider creating a public version of the report to share with your community, fostering transparency and collaboration.

    </Steps>

1. **Add predictive insights and testing.**

    Enhance your decision-making process by adding predictive insights and testing to your monitoring system. This can help you anticipate trends, identify potential issues, and continuously improve your projects.
