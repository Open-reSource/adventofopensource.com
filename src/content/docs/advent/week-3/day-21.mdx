**As your project grows, you might discover contributors and users from diverse linguistic backgrounds.** Translating your project can make it more accessible to a global audience, fostering inclusivity and potentially boosting engagement. Offering translations for your documentation, website, or interface demonstrates a commitment to accessibility and ensures that non-English-speaking users can benefit from your work.

**Today's challenge focuses on exploring how to set up a translation process for your project.** We'll help you weigh the pros and cons, introduce a basic structure for handling translations, and create the foundation for a multilingual project. While this is an entry-level setup, you'll also learn where to go next if your project scales to require more advanced multilingual solutions.

<Steps>

1. **Consider the benefits and challenges of translations.**

    Before diving into translations, it's essential to evaluate whether they align with your project's goals and resources. Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons to help you decide:

    | **Pros** | **Cons** |
    |---|---|
    | Reach a wider, global audience | Time-consuming to set up and maintain |
    | Improve accessibility and user inclusivity | Requires translation expertise or tools |
    | Enhance the user experience for non-English speakers | Ongoing maintenance as content evolves |
    | Attract contributions from a broader community | Risk of inconsistent translations across pages |

    <Aside>
    **If you decide translations aren't necessary, feel free to skip this challenge** and use today's time to work on another aspect of your project, and take some time to code!
    </Aside>

    **If you decide to proceed**, the next steps will guide you through the process by starting with a simple setup for translations that aligns with your current repository structure, including a Markdown-based GitHub Pages website powered by Jekyll.

    Several translations approaches exist, you'll choose the one that fits your project best if your project's webiste and content evolves, by using other tech stacks.

1. **Choose Your Initial Languages.**

    Start with just one additional language to keep things manageable. For the purpose of this challenge, we'll focus on adding French translations.

    Once you're comfortable, you can expand to other languages.

1. **Set up a translation-friendly directory structure.**

    Organize your files into a `docs/` directory. This structure will separate translations and maintain consistency:

    <FileTree>

    - docs
      - en
        - index.md
        - installation.md 
      - fr
        - index.md
        - installation.md
    - index.md

    </FileTree>

    Move all original English content under `docs/en/` folder, and copy it into `docs/fr/` for future French translations.

1. **Add language switching links.**

    Modify the root `index.md` file to include links for switching between available languages:

    ```markdown title="index.md"
    [English](en/index.md) | [Français](fr/index.md)
    ```

    Ensure every translated page also includes a language switcher to enhance navigation consistency.

1. **Translate key pages.**

    Start small by translating the most critical pages, such as `docs/fr/index.md` and `docs/fr/installation.md` files into French.

1. **Document the translation workflow.**

    Create a `TRANSLATIONS.md` file or a new section in your `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to outline how translations should be managed: the translation workflow, guidelines, and best practices.

    ```markdown title="TRANSLATIONS.md"
    # How to Contribute Translations

    ## Folder Structure

    - English (default): `docs/en/`
    - Translations: `docs/<language_code>/` (e.g., `docs/fr/`)

    ## Steps to Translate

    1. Copy the file from `docs/en/` to the desired language folder (e.g., `docs/fr/`).
    2. Translate the content while preserving the Markdown structure.
    3. Submit a pull request with your updates.

    ## Best Practices

    - Use consistent terminology across translations.
    - Review translations for accuracy and clarity.

    For questions or help, reach out via [GitHub Discussions](link-to-discussions).
    ```

    Make it clear that contributors should prioritize clarity and accuracy in translations.

</Steps>

<Aside>
To go further, please refer to the [GitHub documentation - Setting up a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/), and to the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

This approach is a basic starting point for handling translations. Here are a few ideas to improve it:
- Add automatic redirection to the user's preferred language based on browser settings (requires JavaScript or server configuration).
- Use translation management tools like [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/), [Lokalise](https://lokalise.com/), [Weblate](https://weblate.org), or [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/) for more advanced translation workflows.
- Integrate advanced multilingual frameworks if your project scales. For example, [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) or [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) support translations out of the box.
- Make sure each translated page includes the `<html lang="...">` attribute for accessibility.
</Aside>

**Translations can transform your project by making it more inclusive and accessible.** Starting with a basic structure allows you to experiment with adding languages without overwhelming your workflow. As your project evolves, you can build on this foundation to implement more robust solutions.

**Remember, even a single translated page can significantly improve accessibility for non-English speakers.** Engage your community to help maintain translations, ensuring your project remains welcoming to contributors worldwide.

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>

- ✓ A `docs/` directory structure ready for translations.
- ✓ A basic language switcher implemented with at least one additional language.
- ✓ A documented workflow for contributing translations.

**As your Open Source project grows, so does its potential to reach a global audience.** Multilingual support helps users and contributors from different regions engage with your project more effectively. By setting up a robust translation workflow and creating clear guidelines, you ensure consistency and encourage contributions from volunteers worldwide.

**Today's challenge focuses on organizing the translation workflow for your project.**

If you don't already have a basic internationalization (i18n) system in place, check [today's beginner challenge](#beginner-prepare-for-translations) to learn how to implement one. For this challenge, we'll go beyond setup, diving into workflows, guidelines, and building a translation team to ensure the smooth management of multilingual content.

<Aside>
**If you decide translations aren't necessary, feel free to skip this challenge** and use today's time to work on another aspect of your project, and take some time to code!
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. **Review your translation setup.**

    Audit your current translation system.

    Confirm that your project already has an internationalization (i18n) system in place with a basic structure for managing translations, such as separate directories for each language, or a translation management tool. If you don't have these basics yet and consider translations for your project, refer to the [beginner challenge](#beginner-prepare-for-translations) to set up a foundation.

    If you're using an external tool with string extraction and translation features, ensure dynamic retrieval of strings and fallback language support are in place.

1. **Establish a translation workflow.**

    Define a clear process for managing translations in your project. This workflow should cover how translations are added, reviewed, and tested before being integrated into the project.

    A workflow might include these definitions:
    - **Translation management**: precise what tools or services you use to manage translations. For example, [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/), [Lokalise](https://lokalise.com/), [Weblate](https://weblate.org), or [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/) can allow collaborative editing, tracking changes, and integrating with version control systems.
    - **String extraction**: if applicable, ensure developers extract all translatable strings consistently. Tools like [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) can help automating this process.
    - **Assigning translators**: define how translators are assigned and how they submit translations. You can use a mix of community contributions and professional translators.
    - **Review and approval**: create a review process for proposed translations, ideally involving native speakers for accuracy.
    - **Integration testing**: test translations in the application to ensure correct rendering, spacing, and context.

1. **Document the workflow.**

    Create a `TRANSLATIONS.md` file or a new section in your `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to outline the translation process.

    Write a step-by-step guide for contributors detailing how translations are added, reviewed, and tested.

    Include examples of good and bad practices for string extraction and translation contributions.

1. **Create translation guidelines.**

    On top of the workflow, establish guidelines for translators to ensure consistency across languages. These guidelines should cover tone, terminology, and formatting to maintain a cohesive user experience.

    - **Style and tone**: Set guidelines for the tone of your translations (e.g., formal or casual). Provide examples of common phrases to ensure consistency.
    - **Create a glossary**: Include definitions of technical terms and project-specific language.
    - **Address formatting rules**: Specify formatting for dates, times, and currencies based on language preferences.
    - **Provide examples**: Share examples of well-translated strings alongside poorly translated ones to highlight best practices.

1. **Build a translation team.**

    Encourage community members to contribute translations by creating a dedicated team. This team can consist of volunteers, professional translators, or a mix of both. It's important to have a diverse group of translators to ensure accuracy and cultural relevance, but also to have the same people involved in the long term to ensure consistency.

    - **Recruit volunteers**: Reach out to your community for contributors who are fluent in the target languages. Use GitHub Discussions, social media, or other platforms to invite participation.
    - **Set up roles**: Define clear roles for translators, reviewers, and maintainers. This hierarchy ensures translations are consistently high quality.
    - **Onboard translators**: Provide new contributors with access to your workflow and guidelines. Offer a quick-start guide to help them navigate your translation management tool and the repository.
    - **Acknowledge contributions**: Recognize the efforts of your translation team by highlighting their contributions in your project's documentation or website.

1. **Automate and optimize.**

    Explore automation tools and services to streamline the translation process. Automating string extraction, translation updates, and quality checks can save time and reduce the risk of errors.

    Use CI/CD pipelines to verify translations automatically. For example:
    - Check for missing keys in translation files using tools
    - Validate formatting for placeholders (e.g., `{0}`, `%s`) to prevent runtime errors.

    If you plan to support many languages, consider using Translation Memory systems. These tools reuse existing translations to save time and maintain consistency.

</Steps>
