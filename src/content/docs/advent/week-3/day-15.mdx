<h2>The Heart of the Commons</h2>

The _Keeper_ leads you into a lush, glowing chamber known as the _Heart of the Commons_. Here, a constant pulse reverberates through the air, steady and strong, like the lifeline of a great endeavor. At the chamber's core stands the _Custodian of Vitality_, a figure surrounded by radiant orbs that shimmer with hues of connection and energy.

> The pulse must remain steady,

the _Custodian_ says, their hands gently tracing the glow of an orb.

> When the rhythm falters, a shadow falls—the _Fog of Fragmentation_. It obscures pathways and weakens bonds, leaving those who seek guidance lost in its haze.

They look to you with quiet determination.

> To preserve this harmony, the pulse must be nurtured. Every small action, every thoughtful gesture strengthens it, ensuring that all who journey here feel supported and connected. This is how the Heart beats strong.

## Beginner: Improve the About Section

<hr />

<Lore type="snowflake">
As you approach the _Heart of the Commons_, the _Custodian of Vitality_ beckons you toward a softly glowing pedestal. Upon it rests a bound tome, its pages filled with faintly shimmering text and illustrations.

> This is the _Book of First Impressions_,

the _Custodian_ explains, their voice warm with reverence.

> It is often the first glimpse into the essence of this place, the beacon that welcomes wanderers and guides them on their path.

They turn a page, revealing faded lines and incomplete sketches.

> But even the brightest beacons need tending,

they continue.

> Strengthen these words, make them vivid, and let the illustrations shine with clarity. When the _Book of First Impressions_ is strong, the pulse of the _Heart_ grows steadier, and the haze of the _Fog of Fragmentation_ begins to lift.

With a gentle smile, they hand you a quill whose ink glows faintly, waiting to bring the tome's words to life.

A strong repository profile is the first impression your project gives to users and potential contributors. A well-presented profile doesn't just highlight the work you've done; it makes your project inviting, clear, and easier to discover by search engines or through platforms like GitHub. With a polished profile, you can better attract collaborators who share your vision and expand the project's reach.

**Today's challenge is all about refining your project's repository profile.** You'll update its description, add topics for better discoverability, and review its homepage sections for clarity. These improvements will make your repository more professional and engaging, whether you're aiming to attract new contributors, showcase your work to potential users, or simply organize your project's presence.

<Steps>

1. **Open the _About_ section.**

    You created your repository on the first day of the Advent of Open Source, but perhaps without a clear vision for its direction. Now that you've had some time to develop the project further, it's a great opportunity to update its key information and refine its presentation.

    Navigate to your repository, and on the right side, in the _About_ section, click the edit button. A popup will open where you can update the following:

    - **Description**
    - **Website**
    - **Topics**
    - **Sections** to include in the home page:
      - Releases
      - Packages
      - Deployments

    <ContentImage src={day15Snowflake01} alt="" />

1. **Update the description.**

    Write an engaging sentence or two about your project. Avoid technical jargon and focus on clarity and purpose. Remember to update the description in your README file as well to maintain consistency between the repository's main page and its detailed documentation.

    For example: "An Open Source CLI tool to simplify Docker container management. Features include container pruning, memory stats, and health checks."

    <Aside type="tip" title="Consistency">
    You might want to update the description in your README file as well with a longer version, to keep it consistent with the repository's main page.
    </Aside>

1. **Update the URL.**

    If your project has a website or a documentation page, add the URL here. This will make it easier for users to find more information about your project and contribute to its development.

    Don't worry if you don't have a website yet; you can always add it later.

1. **Add topics.**

    Add 5 to 10 relevant tags to make your project easier to find. Topics can include:

    - Programming language or stack used (e.g., `javascript`, `react`, `python`)
    - Project type (e.g., `library`, `tool`, `framework`)
    - Intended audience (e.g., `beginner-friendly`, `hacktoberfest`)
    - Domain, industry, or use case (e.g., `data-visualization`, `e-commerce`)

    <Aside type="tip" title="Looking for inspiration?">
    Use tools like [GitHub Topic Explorer](https://github.com/topics) for inspiration.
    </Aside>

    <ContentImage src={day15Snowflake02} alt="" />

1. **Configure the homepage sections.**

    Depending on your project's progress, you might want to update the sections displayed on the home page:

    - Keep at least the _Releases_ section that will display the list of the releases, and you already released a first version of your project the other day.
    - Except if you're a little bit more advanced, you can keep the _Packages_ and _Deployments_ sections unchecked for now.

1. **Save your changes.**

    Click on the _Save changes_ button to apply your updates.

    <ContentImage src={day15Snowflake03} alt="" />

</Steps>

**Congratulations! You've just improved your repository's profile**, making it more inviting and discoverable for potential contributors. A polished profile goes a long way in establishing your project as organized and beginner-friendly. As your project evolves, revisit and refine these details to reflect new features, versions, or directions.

Remember, a clear and engaging repository profile is not just about attracting contributors—it also helps you articulate the project's mission and purpose. With a stronger profile, your project is better positioned to grow its community.

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>

- ✓ Description updated in the _About_ section, and optionally in the README.
- ✓ Topics added to the repository.
- ✓ Homepage sections refined based on project progress.
- ✓ (Optional) Website or documentation URL added if available.

The quill still hums softly in your hand as the _Custodian of Vitality_ examines the tome you've restored. The once-faded pages now gleam with clarity and vibrancy, each word and image shining like a beacon.

> You've brought new life to the _Book of First Impressions_,

the _Custodian_ says, their voice brimming with approval.

> Now, its light will draw wanderers and seekers, offering them guidance and assurance as they step into the Heart.

As the book settles back onto its pedestal, the pulse of the chamber grows stronger, its rhythm steady and confident. The _Custodian_ places a hand on your shoulder, their gratitude evident.

> Never underestimate the power of a welcoming beacon. It is the first step in forging lasting connections, a spark that lights the way forward.

With the tome restored, you take a step back, feeling the steady pulse resonate in your own heart. You know that the path ahead will be brighter for those who follow.

<h3>The Custodian's Wisdom</h3>

> A thriving community is the heartbeat of an artifact. By nurturing its health, you ensure its growth and longevity. Remember, the stronger the pulse, the more resilient the artifact. 

Strengthen your artifact's ties, traveller, and keep the pulse steady. Your journey through _The Chorus of Contribution_ continues as you build a community that endures.

## Intermediate: Optimize Discoverability

<hr />

<Lore type="snowball">
The _Custodian of Vitality_ leads you to a towering prism in the _Heart of the Commons_, its many facets catching and refracting the chamber's glowing light. Despite its beauty, some sides of the prism remain dull, shrouded in shadow.

> This prism represents the reach of the _Heart_'s glow,

the _Custodian_ explains, running their hand over the gleaming surface.

> Each facet reflects a different path—some leading to those who seek knowledge, others guiding those who wish to lend their strength. Yet, many of these paths are hidden, lost in the shadows.

They gesture toward a set of tools arranged neatly on a nearby table—lenses, chisels, and brushes that gleam with potential.

> By refining these facets, you can ensure that the _Heart_'s light reaches farther, illuminating the way for those who might otherwise never find it. Every connection strengthens the pulse, every beam of light is a chance to grow.

The _Custodian_ smiles, their confidence in your abilities clear.

> Begin your work. Help the light find its way.

</Lore>

**In the crowded world of Open Source projects, standing out can be challenging.** Contributors and users often discover projects through repositories, search engines, and community platforms, but without proper optimization, your project might remain hidden. Improving the discoverability of your repository ensures it reaches the right audience, increases engagement, and attracts contributors who align with your vision. Simple updates, strategic use of keywords, and clear messaging can make your project more accessible and appealing.
